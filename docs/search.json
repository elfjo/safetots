For example, the physiological range of blood pressure that allows adequate organ perfusion and oxygen delivery to pediatric populations during the perioperative period is essentially unknown. Relatedly, the systemic blood pressure values leading to cerebral hypoperfusion are poorly defined. Neither we know to what extent intraoperative cerebral hypoperfusion may lead to brain injury during routine general anesthesia.

Based on available current evidence, the European Consensus statement on the use of general anesthesia in pediatric populations recommends no change in clinical practice.\nThere are, nevertheless, several questions remaining open. First, we do not know whether our current methodology to evaluate neuromorbidity is appropriate or some aspects of behavior/cognition are missed. Second, we do not know if there are specific genetic/epigenetic backgrounds displaying increased vulnerability to anesthesia/surgery. Third, we do not know how anesthetic drugs interact with surgery and other perioperative factors in terms neuromorbidity. Both preclinical models and clinical studies are warranted on these questions.\nOne important issue is that, since we do not know how to measure it, we do not directly measure neuromorbidity in the perioperative period.

The mean heart rate in neonates in the first 24 hours is 120 beats per minute, it increases to a mean of 160 beats per minute at 1 month of age, after which it gradually decreases to 75 beats per min at adolescence (Table 1).\nIn young children cardiac output is very much depended on heart rate and any heart rate &lt; 100 beats per minute should be explored further and treated if necessary.\nIn older children, a significant number of arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities are also encountered, with marked fluctuations in heart rate caused by variations in autonomic tone.\n———————————————————————– Age Mean heart rate in beats per minute (range) —————– —————————————————–  Premature 120-170  0-3 months 100-150 3-6 months 90-120  6-12 months  80-120  1-3 years 70-110   3-6 years 65-110  6-12 years 60-95   &gt; 12 years 55-85 ———————————————————————– Table 1.

Hypothermia during anesthesia has many harmful consequences and may trigger multiple physiological changes (increased metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, prolonged bleeding time and increased risk for postoperative infection) and influence the pharmacokinetic and –dynamics of anesthetics.\nHyperthermia most commonly occurs because of iatrogenic overheating and failure to decrease the temperature of the exogenous heat source in the face of an increasingly body temperature. Other causes of hyperthermia include malignant hyperthermia, thyrotoxicosis and sepsis.\n\n\n\nTemperature can be monitored in the axilla, bladder, nasopharynx, esophagus, rectum, tympanic membrane and the skin. Core temperature is most accurately measured on the tympanic membrane or the esophagus.\nCore temperature monitoring should be monitored in procedures lasting more than 30 min with an effort to maintain temperature &gt; 36°C. External forced-air warming should be used to prevent hypothermia. Ambient temperature should be maintained between 21°and 26°C with a relative humidity level of 40-60%. IV solutions should be considered warmed to 38°C in high risk cases.\n\n\n\n\nSessler DI. Temperature monitoring and perioperative thermoregulation. Anesthesiology 2008; 109: 318-38\nSessler DI.

Just after birth the sympathetic control begins to appear, although the parasympathetic nervous system continues to dominate in childhood decreasing only in adolescence.\nIn neonates and infants, the heart rate may have a wide variation that is still within normal limits. The mean heart rate in neonates in the first 24 hours is 120 beats per minute, it increases to a mean of 160 beats per minute at 1 month of age, after which it gradually decreases to 75 beats per min at adolescence (Table 1).\nIn young children cardiac output is very much depended on heart rate and any heart rate &lt; 100 beats per minute should be explored further and treated if necessary.\nIn older children, a significant number of arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities are also encountered, with marked fluctuations in heart rate caused by variations in autonomic tone.\n———————————————————————– Age Mean heart rate in beats per minute (range) —————– —————————————————–  Premature 120-170  0-3 months 100-150 3-6 months 90-120  6-12 months  80-120  1-3 years 70-110   3-6 years 65-110  6-12 years 60-95   &gt; 12 years 55-85 ———————————————————————– Table 1.

Hypothermia during anesthesia has many harmful consequences and may trigger multiple physiological changes (increased metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, prolonged bleeding time and increased risk for postoperative infection) and influence the pharmacokinetic and –dynamics of anesthetics.\nHyperthermia most commonly occurs because of iatrogenic overheating and failure to decrease the temperature of the exogenous heat source in the face of an increasingly body temperature. Other causes of hyperthermia include malignant hyperthermia, thyrotoxicosis and sepsis.\n\n\n\nTemperature can be monitored in the axilla, bladder, nasopharynx, esophagus, rectum, tympanic membrane and the skin. Core temperature is most accurately measured on the tympanic membrane or the esophagus.\nCore temperature monitoring should be monitored in procedures lasting more than 30 min with an effort to maintain temperature &gt; 36°C. External forced-air warming should be used to prevent hypothermia. Ambient temperature should be maintained between 21°and 26°C with a relative humidity level of 40-60%. IV solutions should be considered warmed to 38°C in high risk cases.\n\n\n\n\nSessler DI. Temperature monitoring and perioperative thermoregulation. Anesthesiology 2008; 109: 318-38\nSessler DI.

    "text": "Rights of the Child (10Rs)\n Children’s rights are human rights. In 1989 the United Nations declared the Convention of the Rights of Children [1], promoting the rights and the protection of children to develop their full potential, free from hunger and want, neglect and abuse.\nArticle 24 of the UN’s Convention of the Rights of Children addresses the rights and the special demands of children in health care institutions recognizing that children are especially vulnerable.\nThe EACH Charter (1988)3 recognizes and endorses the rights of the child as stipulated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and in particular the key principle that, in all situations, the best interests of the child should prevail (art.3).\nAs commitment to the Convention of the Rights of Children and The EACH Charter the Safetots.org initiative adjusted this to the perioperative situation and issued the following 10 Rights (10 R).\n\nRight to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health\n“Children have the right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health. Specialist pediatric anesthesia care should be provided for all children. Particularly children aged less than three years should be treated by experienced staff that follows continuous education, regular training and updates to maintain their competencies. Children who have significant co-morbidity and those who requiring highly specialized or major surgery benefit from specialized anesthetic care in dedicated pediatric centers.” [1]\n\n\nRight to non-discrimination\n“All children should be treated in a respectful and empathic way, whatever their race, religion or abilities; whatever they think or say, whatever type of family they come from. It doesn’t matter where children live, what language they speak, what their parents do, whether they are boys or girls, what their culture is, whether they have a disability or whether they are rich or poor. No child should be treated unfairly on any basis.” [1]\n\n\nRight to be protected from economic exploitation\n“Children need to be protected from any economic exploitation in health care. Profit-motivated treatment of children in hospitals and medical institutions of low quality should be avoided.” [3]\n\n\nRight to be protected from unnecessary treatment and investigation\n“Children need to be protected from unnecessary treatment and investigation. That includes any potential harm and burden associated with their involvement in research, teaching or training of medical staff.” [3]\n\n\nRight to avoid pain, fear and stress\n“All children should be treated without suffering from pain, fear and unnecessary stress. They should benefit from all forms of anesthesia and procedural sedation whenever they or their caregivers ask for. Children should have full access to pain therapy and palliative care.” [3] Some pain, fear and stress may be inevitable but all efforts should be undertaken to minimize this.\n\n\nRight to have their parents with them\n“Children have the right to have their parents with them during the induction of anesthesia and during recovery.” [3] Although this may not always be possible or appropriate, the view of the child and the caregiver should always be taken into account.\n\n\nRight to privacy\n“The privacy of children should be respected at all times during induction and maintenance of anesthesia and recovery. This includes also: protection against exposure during physical examinations and personal, hygiene activities, e.g. dressing, toileting and bathing; protection against treatment and behaviour which diminishes self-respect or makes the child feel ridiculous or humiliated.” [3]\n\n\nRight to be informed\n“Children and adolescents have the right to information on all aspects of health which enables them to make informed choices. They have the right to get and share information about treatment and procedures during anesthesia, sedation and pain-therapy in a manner appropriate to age and understanding as long as the information is not damaging to them or others.

    "text": "Competence (5Ws)\n The 5Ws listed below are closely related to the Rights of the Child (10Rs). In particular children have\n\nthe “Right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health”\nthe “Right to avoid pain, fear and stress”\nthe “Right to have their parents with them”\nThese basic rights are respected if the 5Ws are applied.\n\n\nWho\nAnesthesia for children should always be delivered by competent and appropriately experienced anesthesiologists and care teams. Children aged less than 3 years, ASA physical status ≥ III (all ages), with underlying congenital and metabolic diseases and/or those undergoing major or complex surgery are those at highest risk for perioperative complications and poor outcome. It is recommended that these children should receive care by an anesthesiologist with specific education, training and ongoing experience in pediatric anesthesia.\nAnesthesiologists with mixed practice can deliver pediatric anesthesia for healthy children aged &gt;3 years simple and routine procedures provided they have the adequate expertise and regular practice in pediatric anesthesia. They should maintain their competence with regular exposure to pediatric lists and keep their knowledge up-to-date. This will minimize the occurrence of life-threatening complications.\nContinuing education and regular updates in pediatric centers are recommended to maintain competency. Specialist centers should support those in non-specialist practice.\nResidents and fellows in pediatric anesthesia departments must be supervised in a 1:1 manner by experienced staff during induction and emergence as well as at any time during the anesthesia if required.\n\n\nWhere\nChildren should receive pediatric anesthesia care in children’s hospitals or in general/district hospitals with dedicated pediatric areas.\n\nRegionalization of pediatric anesthesia\nThe pediatric population is too small to allow maintenance of sufficient skills for every anesthesiologist. Care of children undergoing anesthesia should ideally be regionalized in specialized pediatric settings staffed by pediatric anesthesiologists and pediatric nurses.\nIn particular, the most vulnerable pediatric population, such as neonates and infants, those with co-morbidities and with underlying congenital and metabolic diseases as well as children undergoing major or complex surgery require referral to appropriately resourced multidisciplinary pediatric environments.\n\n\nAdvantages of specialized children’s hospitals\n\n24/7 pediatric anesthesia emergency service\nSpecialized pediatric nursing staff\nAppropriate equipment for daily routine and critical situations for all targeted age groups\nDevelopment and implementation of standard operating protocols (SOP) for routine processes and crisis situations\nPediatric pain service\nPediatric Intensive Care provision\n\n\n\nDistrict hospitals providing pediatric anesthesia care\nAnesthesia for elective routine operations in otherwise stable and healthy children can be performed in district hospitals by teams with sufficient expertise in pediatric anesthesia. This requires appropriate staffing, equipment, facilities and support services.\nOut of hours and emergency care must be provided by a team with sufficient expertise in pediatric anesthesia in a suitable environment with clear operational policies.\n\n\nRemote Areas and the Critically Ill Child\nChildren who undergo anesthesia in remote areas (imaging, interventional procedures, dental suites and other special facilities) and who require deep sedation or general anesthesia must receive the same standard of care.\nAn effective referral and retrieval system must be in place for the transfer of critical ill children.\n\n\n\nWhat\nPediatric patients requiring highly specialized or major surgery (cardiac, thoracic, major visceral, major orthopedic, neurosurgical, burns and craniofacial procedures), those with significant and uncontrolled co-morbidities as well as critically ill children will benefit from specialized anesthetic care in dedicated pediatric centers.\nAnesthesia for routine operations (common ENT/ORL procedures, simple fractures, wound repairs, laparoscopic appendectomy) in otherwise stable and healthy children can be performed in district hospitals by specialist pediatric anesthesiologists or anesthesiologists with an expertise in pediatric anesthesia provided appropriate staffing, equipment, facilities and support services are in place.\n\n\nWhen\nCareful considerations must be given to balance the increased perioperative risks for newborns and infants and the impact of delaying elective procedures/diagnostics for the well-being of the child.\nA delay in elective or scheduled procedures may result in avoidable emergency procedures, which do carry a higher peri-operative risk.\n\n\nHoW\nHigh Quality and Safe Anesthesia Care promotes the well-being of the child (see Rights of the Child). It maintains physiological homeostasis (see 10Ns) and addresses the known peri-operative risk factors (See 10Cs) in an appropriately resourced multidisciplinary pediatric environment.\nExpertise in all pediatric anesthetic techniques is required to provide optimal care for all children in all situations. Several European countries have well established ‘pediatric anesthesia fellowships’ with the duration of one or two years.\nThis is a mandatory prerequisite for those anesthesiologists that are willing to provide specialized pediatric care. In countries where a pediatric fellowship program is not established, the European Training Requirements (ETR) should be considered.\n\n\nReferences\n\nRCoA.

Just after birth the sympathetic control begins to appear, although the parasympathetic nervous system continues to dominate in childhood decreasing only in adolescence.\nIn neonates and infants, the heart rate may have a wide variation that is still within normal limits. The mean heart rate in neonates in the first 24 hours is 120 beats per minute, it increases to a mean of 160 beats per minute at 1 month of age, after which it gradually decreases to 75 beats per min at adolescence (Table 1).\nIn young children cardiac output is very much depended on heart rate and any heart rate &lt; 100 beats per minute should be explored further and treated if necessary.\nIn older children, a significant number of arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities are also encountered, with marked fluctuations in heart rate caused by variations in autonomic tone.\n———————————————————————– Age Mean heart rate in beats per minute (range) —————– —————————————————–  Premature 120-170  0-3 months 100-150 3-6 months 90-120  6-12 months  80-120  1-3 years 70-110   3-6 years 65-110  6-12 years 60-95   &gt; 12 years 55-85 ———————————————————————– Table 1.

Hypothermia during anesthesia has many harmful consequences and may trigger multiple physiological changes (increased metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, prolonged bleeding time and increased risk for postoperative infection) and influence the pharmacokinetic and –dynamics of anesthetics.\nHyperthermia most commonly occurs because of iatrogenic overheating and failure to decrease the temperature of the exogenous heat source in the face of an increasingly body temperature. Other causes of hyperthermia include malignant hyperthermia, thyrotoxicosis and sepsis.\n\n\nPrevention and Treatment\nTemperature can be monitored in the axilla, bladder, nasopharynx, esophagus, rectum, tympanic membrane and the skin. Core temperature is most accurately measured on the tympanic membrane or the esophagus.\nCore temperature monitoring should be monitored in procedures lasting more than 30 min with an effort to maintain temperature &gt; 36°C. External forced-air warming should be used to prevent hypothermia. Ambient temperature should be maintained between 21°and 26°C with a relative humidity level of 40-60%. IV solutions should be considered warmed to 38°C in high risk cases.\n\n\nKey references\n\nSessler DI. Temperature monitoring and perioperative thermoregulation.

PONV leads to additional discomfort, morbidity and costs.\n\n\nConsequences\nPONV is an unpleasant experience resulting in a variety of significant consequences which include:\n\nadditional burden for the child, parents, clinician and nurses\nincreased postoperative morbidity, pain, dehydration and surgical complications\ndelayed discharge and increased re-admission\nadditional medication and increased workload\n\n\n\nGood Practice Points\n\nassess risk factors from patient history, type of surgery and type of anesthesia\nestablish local standard operating protocols for the prevention and treatment of PONV according to current evidence-based guidelines (see below)\nbe aware of factors unrelated to current condition which could cause or exacerbate PONV (intestinal, brain, hypotension, allergic reaction, drug side effects)\n\n\n\nFollow-Up/ Outcome\n\naudit incidence and severity of PONV\naudit use of antiemetic protocols and compliance with protocols\nQI initiatives to reduce in-hospital and post-discharge PONV\n\n\n\nKey references\n\n“This is the 2nd edition of the APAGBI evidence-based guidelines on prevention of postoperative vomiting in children from 2016. It gives practical well-founded advice on how to identify those paediatric patients most at risk for PONV, how to prevent PONV using commonly available drugs and how to treat PONV once it has occurred. Other techniques are also reviewed which may be helpful in individual cases even though the evidence for their efficacy is less robust.” APAGBI.

Early recognition and effective intervention using a structured approach is required.\n\n\nBackground\n\nsmall children have short and narrow airways requiring small and fragile airway equipment\nobstruction and dislocation of airway devices are common during moving and positioning\ngastric distension significantly reduces functional residual capacity in small children and may considerably impair ventilation and gas exchange\nlimited oxygenation and respiratory reserves in small children result in rapid development of hypoxemia, carbon dioxide accumulation and respiratory acidosis. High closing capacity in small children increases likelihood of pulmonary atelectasis leading to intra-pulmonary shunt and hypoxemia\nrapid administration of potent opioids may lead to thoracic rigidity\npediatric patients are at higher risk for bronchial hyper-reactivity particularly those with respiratory infection, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or allergic diathesis\ncongenital and acquired diseases may affect lower airway patency or can lead to an acute tracheal tube obstruction\n\n\n\nPrevention\n\ncorrect positioning of tracheal tube and safe, effective fixation of airway devices is paramount\nsuitable and careful positioning and moving of patients with tracheal tube. Reassess proper position of airway devices after re-positioning.\nensure stable position when oral procedures (ENT, cleft surgery, gastroenterology, cardiology (transesophageal echocardiography) are performed\nensure adequate depth of anesthesia (+/- muscle paralysis)\nperform appropriate ventilation and recruitment strategies\nconsider gastric decompression following airway manoeuvres\nchildren with copious secretions or pus are at risk of tracheal tube obstruction and patency requires regular checking and confirmation\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\ncall for assistance, if in doubt – take it out\nthe acronym DOPES summarizes the most relevant immediately life-threatening causes and interventions that effectively treat the ‘Can Intubate – Can’t Ventilate’ situation\nExclude and treat\nD – Displacement of tracheal tube (endobronchial, esophageal and pharyngeal)\nO – Obstruction of tracheal tube, respiratory valves or respiratory filter with secretion and functional airway obstructions (severe bronchospasm, opioids)\nP – Pneumothorax\nE – Equipment problems (disconnection, kinking of respiratory tubing)\nS – Stomach & Specials (increased intra-abdominal pressure, pulmonary pathology, pulmonary-arterial hypertension, cardiac right-to-left shunts, alveolar collapse)\n\n\n\nPost Care\n\ndebriefing is essential (patient, parent, staff)\ndocumentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet) if appropriate\nfollow–up if and when required\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEngelhardt T, Fiadjoe JE, Weiss M, Baker P, Bew S, Echeverry Marín P, von Ungern-Sternberg BS.

Primary treatment is directed to maintaining oxygenation and circulation before initiating lipid rescue.\n\n\nBackground\n\nlocal anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) occurs when large quantities of local anesthetics reach the systemic circulation and depends on multiple variables and presents in various clinical ways ranging from mild neurological symptoms to cardiac toxicity and death\nearly symptoms and signs of LAST are masked in children if regional anesthesia is administered during general anesthesia and sedation\ncardiac toxicity of local anesthetics is increased by acidosis and hypoxemia\n\n\n\nPrevention\n\nknowledge of maximum dose and concentration is essential and it is important to individualize the choice of drug, dose and concentration based on the patient’s clinical condition and comorbidities\nthe ‘Stop before you block’ principle allows checking of patient relevant information, dose, contra-indication and type and site of regional anesthesia before injection local anesthetics\ncareful aspiration, passive back-flow, slow injection, test dose with added epinephrine (1:200,000) and close hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure in 1-minute intervals, pulse oximetry and ECG) allows early detection of inadvertent systemic administration and avoidance of LAST\nconfirm maximum dose of continuous administration local anesthetic for neonates and infants as well older children\nensure availability of:\nResuscitative equipment and drugs\nAirway equipment: the means to provide bag mask ventilation, oral and nasal airways, laryngoscopes and endotracheal tubes, laryngeal mask airways\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\nwhen suspecting LAST, stop injecting more local anesthetic and call for help\nsupportive measures to maintain the airway and oxygenation and treating seizures are usually sufficient\nmaintaining cardiac output using epinephrine and external cardiac massage if necessary results in re-distribution and clearance of the local anesthetic\nsecondary administration of lipid solutions may be useful in severe cases and hasten recovery from LAST\n\n\n\nPost Care\n\npatient disclosure and careful documentation are required\nif an allergic reaction is considered arrange further workup and follow-up\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBernards CM, Hadzic A, Suresh S, Neal JM.

    "text": "Research\nimg\n\nWhy Research into Safe Conduct of Anesthesia is important\nThe most important unsolved question is how to define “safe conduct” in pediatric anesthesia. In other words, what outcomes should we use to measure the “success” of anesthesia and perioperative care? This research priority generates many more fundamental questions:\n\nWhat outcomes matter most to our patients and their families?\nWhat outcomes are most important to clinicians?\nWhat are the most important outcome measures for clinical researchers?\nAre these outcomes aligned?\nCan we, do we, should we routinely measure these outcomes in everyday clinical practice and/or in clinical trials?\nHow can we improve these outcomes? (See Quality Improvement)\n\n\n\nWhat are the necessary steps to determine outcomes?\n\nIdentification of outcome measures and indicators\nClinical expert- along with other stakeholders-based consensus is necessary to identify indicators that could act as outcome measures in upcoming observational studies and trials. Such outcome measures have been established in adults and effort is currently under way in pediatric populations.\n\n\nEstablishment of large multi-centric electronic databases of perioperative electronic records and pre-identified indicators\nSuch global Big data approach will foster benchmarking and continuous quality assessment/improvement at the individual, institutional and inter-institutional levels. It will also facilitate clinical research at a large scale.\n\n\nEpidemiological studies, observational studies and trials\nConduct of clinical research based on generally accepted and pre-identified outcome measures/indicators will most probably present a higher public health relevance. Such an approach will also facilitate comparing studies between each other and may open the way to increased funding resources.\n\n\nThe influence of clinical expertise on outcome\nThere is a general agreement between pediatric anesthesia providers that expertise matters on outcome. Although, for obvious ethical reasons, no randomized trial design can address this issue, there is epidemiological data suggesting a positive correlation between the level of expertise and outcome (or on the incidence of critical events).\n\n\nPre-clinical and clinical physiological studies to determine “safe”\nWhile there is a general consensus between anesthesia providers to maintain physiological parameters in the “normal” or “safe” range during the perioperative period, we often do not know what these safe values are. For example, the physiological range of blood pressure that allows adequate organ perfusion and oxygen delivery to pediatric populations during the perioperative period is essentially unknown. Relatedly, the systemic blood pressure values leading to cerebral hypoperfusion are poorly defined. Neither we know to what extent intraoperative cerebral hypoperfusion may lead to brain injury during routine general anesthesia. The interaction between hypotension – hypo/hyperglycemia – hyo/hypercapnia in the perioperative setting also remains to be determined. Both preclinical laboratory models and clinical investigations will be necessary to better elucidate these questions.\n\n\nResearch on neurodevelopmental outcomes\nOver the past 15 years, there has been considerable interests about the effects of general anesthetics on the developing brain. Laboratory studies have shown that these drugs can have a variety effects on the developing animal brain. Retrospective human epidemiological observations have revealed mixed results, while prospective studies and trials showed no impact of anesthesia/surgery on neurodevelopmental outcome as assessed by a battery of cognitive tests. Based on available current evidence, the European Consensus statement on the use of general anesthesia in pediatric populations recommends no change in clinical practice.\nThere are, nevertheless, several questions remaining open. First, we do not know whether our current methodology to evaluate neuromorbidity is appropriate or some aspects of behavior/cognition are missed. Second, we do not know if there are specific genetic/epigenetic backgrounds displaying increased vulnerability to anesthesia/surgery. Third, we do not know how anesthetic drugs interact with surgery and other perioperative factors in terms neuromorbidity. Both preclinical models and clinical studies are warranted on these questions.\nOne important issue is that, since we do not know how to measure it, we do not directly measure neuromorbidity in the perioperative period. Research and development of tools (along with the validation of these tools) to measure neuromorbidity will be essential to gain further insights into the effects of the perioperative period on the developing human brain."

    "text": "Parental discussion\n What to include in discussions of benefits and risks of anesthesia and analgesia with children, parents and families\n\nHow can I reassure parents who are worried about the risks of anesthesia and analgesia?\n\n\nWhat do we know about the risks of anesthesia and analgesia?\nPeri-operative complications occur more often in neonates, infants and young children when compared with older children and adults, and morbidity and mortality risks are higher at younger ages. The incidence and severity of peri-operative complications are dependent on young age (reduced physiological reserves), pre-operative morbidity, urgency of the procedure as well as the training and experience of the anesthesiologist and the anesthesia team. There is a deﬁnite causal relationship between preventable poor peri-operative anesthetic care and adverse events with persistent poor neurological outcome and mortality in neonates, infants and small children.\nThis table gives an idea of risks and how often they might occur.\n———————————————————————– Risk Risk level  Description —————– ———— —————————————- Restlessness 1 in 10 Very common (“someone in your family”) Sickness 1 in 10 Very common  Dizziness 1 in 10 Very common Headache 1 in 100 Common (“someone in a street”) Chest infection 1 in 1000 Uncommon (“someone in a village”) Damage to teeth 1 in 1000 Uncommon Awareness 1 in 1000 Uncommon Serious allergy 1 in 10 000 Rare (“someone in a small town”) to drugs\nSerious 1 in 10 000 Rare complication of local anaesthesia\nSerious 1 in 10 000 Rare complication of strong pain killers\nBrain damage &lt; 1 in 100 Very rare (“someone in a large town”) 000\nDeath &lt;&lt; 1 in Very rare 100 000\n      ———————————————————————– Compared to the risk of car travel, the risk of serious harm from anesthesia is very small.\n\n\nWhat can I do to minimize risks?\nPediatric anesthesia is usually safe in experienced hands and in well-organized anesthesia departments. Neonates, infants and children with complex needs or undergoing major surgery should be treated in centers by experienced pediatric teams. Older, otherwise healthy children for common elective procedures who are treated in non-pediatric hospitals beneﬁt from anesthesiologists trained and experienced in pediatric anesthesia.A specialist pediatric anesthesiologist has been trained for a minimum of one year at a large pediatric center and may also have a specialist pediatric anesthesia certiﬁcation.\nGood pediatric anesthesia care also requires well trained pediatric nurses, pediatric post-anesthesia recovery facilities, established standard operating protocols (SOPs) as well as continuous education and training. These recommendations apply to all places where children are anesthetized.\n\n\nWhat should I say to the parents or carers of a young infant who express concern about anesthesia and the potential for long-term effects on the brain?\nThere is no proven direct causal adverse effect of general anesthetics on human brain development. Recent reviews of the animal and clinical literature , and the outcome of the GAS study conclude that there is now strong evidence that short single exposure to anesthesia in early life is not associated with any long term significant measurable risk in humans. Some large population-based studies have found evidence for a small difference in tests of academic achievement and school readiness but the differences are small (for example, around 1% decrement in IQ) and this would not have a noticeable impact on the child. Any added risk of anesthesia and surgery is up to 10 times less than other factors such as gender or maternal education. Some studies have found evidence of an association between surgery and anesthesia in early life and increased risk of behavioral disorder or learning disability but the added risk is very small.\nThe central points to explain and emphasize are that:\n\nthe surgery or procedure is only being scheduled because it is necessary\nsurgery cannot be safely performed without adequate anesthesia and analgesia\nmost anaesthetics in children are of short duration\nall babies and children are closely monitored during anesthesia and surgery to maximize safety and minimize side- effects\nthe aim is to provide careful management of pediatric anesthesia by trained personnel within a safe environment respecting the rights of the child (see Rights of the Child, Competence, Quality)\nthere are currently no data to indicate that a single, well conducted anesthetic of short duration causes long-term changes in brain development\nexperimental data and measures used in animals cannot be extrapolated to indicate long-term effects in human infants\n\n\n\nIf I am called to anesthetize a young infant should I instigate a discussion about long-term effects of anesthesia on the developing brain?\nThis depends on the medicolegal approach to disclosure of risks in your country. It is important to do this in an open and non-alarming way and to give reassurance that for all the common risks and potential adverse effects, measures are taken to prevent or minimize these. Rare risks should be mentioned in context and related to risks of everyday life. There may be specific risks for an individual child due to young age, past history, comorbidities, complexity of the surgery or invasiveness of the anesthetic procedure and these should be identified and included in the discussion.\n\n\nShould I alter my current anesthesia practice in response to the current evidence base information or other published statements?\nThere is currently no evidence to support one particular anesthetic technique or drug regimen that has beneﬁt over another in terms of reducing the potential effects of anesthesia on the infant brain. In addition, changing anesthesia practice from a familiar to an unfamiliar technique can itself introduce risk. Trials have begun of new techniques involving agents with neuroprotective properties but results will not be available for some time.\n\n\nIs repeated exposure or long duration exposure to anesthetic agents more harmful than short- duration single exposure?\nThere is only extremely weak human evidence to support the FDA warning that repeated or lengthy use of anesthetic drugs may affect the development of children’s brains. Current data on multiple exposures or longer-term exposures are unsuitable to answer this question at this time and unlikely to be resolved in the future. Evidence from both epidemiological and prospective studies indicates that a single exposure to anesthesia of an hour is safe in terms of brain development. The epidemiological studies carried out so far have not shown major adverse effects on the infant brain that can be speciﬁcally related to anesthesia. Infants who need multiple anesthetics or those who require complex surgery and anesthesia of long duration usually have additional comorbidities that can affect development.\n\n\nIf parents still remain unsure or are concerned about providing consent for anesthesia and surgery, what should I do?\nIn the rare case when parents or carers remain sufficiently concerned to withhold consent for elective procedures, it may be necessary to organize a further discussion with all the relevant disciplines, to discuss the beneﬁts of the procedure/surgery and risks of delay. This may result in postponement for cases that are not urgent. Emergency or urgent surgery may still need to take place, and risks associated with delay clearly outweigh the theoretical issues about anesthesia on long-term cognitive development.\n\n\nWhat can I do to improve the quality of my care?\nThere are many excellent resources that summarize quality improvement science and give examples of quality improvement in anesthesia and perioperative care, including pediatric practice:\n\nRaising the Standard: a compendium of audit recipes (3rd edition) 2012.

    "text": "For Parents\nimg\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\n\nDoes my child need a general anesthetic?\nIf a procedure or test is needed in a child, especially if it may cause distress or pain, or if it may take a long time, or needs the child to be very still, then anesthesia may be needed. Sometimes sedation is an alternative but often anesthesia is more reliable and as safe or safer. If no anesthesia was given for such tests or procedures the results would be bad and severe distress and harm could be caused.\n\n\nIs anesthesia for children safe?\nMost anesthetics in children are short and are for small operations or procedures. These are usually safe in experienced hands and in well-organized departments that are used to caring for children.\n\n\nWhy may some children get more problems with anesthesia?\nSmaller, younger and sicker children may have more problems with anesthesia because there is a smaller safety margin around normal and changes from normal can happen much more quickly. This is especially so in emergency or urgent cases.\nChildren who have complex surgery or longer procedures may also be more at risk of problems. The team needs a lot of training and experience to care for children to keep them safe during and after anesthesia and surgery.\n\n\nWhat sort of problems can occur and how common are they?\nThis table gives an idea of risks and how often they might occur.\n———————————————————————– Risk Risk level  Description ——————- ————- ————————————- Restlessness 1 in 10 Very common (“someone in your family”) Sickness 1 in 10 Very common  Dizziness 1 in 10 Very common Headache 1 in 100 Common (“someone in a street”) Chest infection 1 in 1000 Uncommon (“someone in a village”) Damage to teeth 1 in 1000 Uncommon Awareness 1 in 1000 Uncommon Serious allergy to 1 in 10 000 Rare (“someone in a small town”) drugs\nSerious 1 in 10 000 Rare complication of local anesthesia\nSerious 1 in 10 000 Rare complication of strong pain killers\nBrain damage &lt; 1 in 100 Very rare (“someone in a large town”) 000\nDeath &lt;&lt; 1 in 100 Very rare 000\n      ———————————————————————– To put this in perspective, the risk of serious damage from an anesthetic is much less than the risk of travelling in a car.\n\n\nIs one anesthetic better than others?\nAt the moment there is no proof that one way of giving anesthesia is better than any other but your anesthesiologist will be able to advise on the preferred method for your child.\n\n\nDo anesthetic agents affect the intelligence and development of my child?\nThere is strong evidence in humans that a single, short, well-conducted anesthetic does not have effects on brain development. There is weak evidence that for long, or lots of anesthetics, some effects on behavior and learning in later life may be seen but this has to be balanced against the need for the procedure. Any effects of the anesthetic are around ten times less than other known factors.\nYounger children have an increased risk of problems so could my child’s operation be delayed until they are older? The best age for a procedure should be discussed openly with your team as for some cases there are risks in delaying or postponing procedures.\n\n\nIs it ok to ask if my surgeon and anesthesiologist are qualiﬁed to look after my child?\nAbsolutely. Evidence of qualiﬁcations, training, and experience should be available, and your doctor will be able to show this at an appropriate time. Many doctors also take part in quality assurance programs. Some hospitals have a special accreditation for care of children and are subject to peer review to make sure standards are met and maintained.\n\n\nWhat can I as a parent do to help my child?\nBeing present to give information and comfort to your child are helpful although it can be stressful for you.\n\n\nWhere can I get more information or help?\nFollow these useful links to up to date information and advice.\n\nRights of the child\n\nEACH Charter\nInformation about anesthesia for children, young people and families\nInformation for children, carers and parents.
