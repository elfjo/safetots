## No Fear (10Ns)

### Definition
Fear: Unpleasant emotion caused by an actual or perceived threat, danger, pain, loss or harm.

### Importance
Preoperative anxiety in children may result from the fear of pain, unfamiliar surroundings, a sense of loss of control, the presence of strangers, parental anxiety and many other perceived threats to their world. Some children will openly say they are frightened; others will cry, withdraw, cling to their parents or become agitated.

### Consequences
- anxiety may reduce cooperation; contribute to emergence delirium and increase pain and behavioral disturbances (sleep disturbances or nightmares, enuresis, separation anxiety and increased fear of doctors) after surgery
- up to 50% of children will still have these disturbances two weeks after surgery and some several months
- the incidence is increased after a stormy anesthetic induction and can be reduced if premedication or other strategies are used to reduce preoperative anxiety

### Prevention and treatment
There are 3 strategies that can be used to reduce or moderate anxiety:

- age-appropriate psychological preparation/ education (e.g. verbal or written information, video, mobile phone app or tablet-pc, hospital tours and role playing)
- parental presence (can be stressful to some parents)
- pharmacological premedication (benzodiazepines, Î±2-agonists, ketamine)

### Special situations and challenges
- the apprehensive child
- the combative child
- refusal
- parental anxiety and expectations

### No Awareness (10Ns)

### Definition
Postoperative recall of sensory perception during general anesthesia (no consensus definition available).

### Importance
- intraoperative awareness is more common in children (0.5-1.0%) compared to adults (0.1-0.2%)
- it may occur in non-paralyzed children without signs of inadequate anesthesia
- does not seem to be associated with distress or post-traumatic stress disorders
- the reasons for the high incidence in children are not known

### Consequences
- unknown, may have major implications on social life

**Risk factors include**
- drugs (neuromuscular blockade, thiopental, TIVA)
- patients (female gender, age (younger adults), obesity, previous awareness, possibly difficult airway management)
- subspecialties (obstetric, trauma, cardio-thoracic, neurosurgical)
- organizational (out-of-hours surgery, junior anesthetist)

### Prevention
- identify risk factors
- proper information preoperatively
- consider the use of neuro-monitoring in patients with risk factors -- particularly if previous awareness

### Treatment
- administer benzodiazepines if awareness is suspected
- if serious psychological problems occur (flash-backs, nightmares, new anxiety states and depression) the child should be referred to psychological service
