### No Fear (10Ns)

#### Definition
Fear: Unpleasant emotion caused by an actual or perceived threat, danger, pain, loss or harm.

#### Importance
Preoperative anxiety in children may result from the fear of pain, unfamiliar surroundings, a sense of loss of control, the presence of strangers, parental anxiety and many other perceived threats to their world. Some children will openly say they are frightened; others will cry, withdraw, cling to their parents or become agitated.

#### Consequences
-   anxiety may reduce cooperation; contribute to emergence delirium and increase pain and behavioral disturbances (sleep disturbances or nightmares, enuresis, separation anxiety and increased fear of doctors) after surgery
-   up to 50% of children will still have these disturbances two weeks after surgery and some several months
-   the incidence is increased after a stormy anesthetic induction and can be reduced if premedication or other strategies are used to reduce preoperative anxiety

#### Prevention and treatment
There are 3 strategies that can be used to reduce or moderate anxiety:
-   age-appropriate psychological preparation/ education (e.g. verbal or written information, video, mobile phone app or tablet-pc, hospital tours and role playing)
-   parental presence (can be stressful to some parents)
-   pharmacological premedication (benzodiazepines, α2-agonists, ketamine)

#### Special situations and challenges
-   the apprehensive child
-   the combative child
-   refusal
-   parental anxiety and expectations

### No Awareness (10Ns)

#### Definition
Postoperative recall of sensory perception during general anesthesia (no consensus definition available).

#### Importance
-   intraoperative awareness is more common in children (0.5-1.0%) compared to adults (0.1-0.2%)
-   it may occur in non-paralyzed children without signs of inadequate anesthesia
-   does not seem to be associated with distress or post-traumatic stress disorders
-   the reasons for the high incidence in children are not known

#### Consequences
-   unknown, may have major implications on social life
**Risk factors include**
-   drugs (neuromuscular blockade, thiopental, TIVA)
-   patients (female gender, age (younger adults), obesity, previous awareness, possibly difficult airway management)
-   subspecialties (obstetric, trauma, cardio-thoracic, neurosurgical)
-   organizational (out-of-hours surgery, junior anesthetist)

#### Prevention
-   identify risk factors
-   proper information preoperatively
-   consider the use of neuro-monitoring in patients with risk factors -- particularly if previous awareness

#### Treatment
-   administer benzodiazepines if awareness is suspected
-   if serious psychological problems occur (flash-backs, nightmares, new anxiety states and depression) the child should be referred to psychological service

### Normovolemia (10Ns)

#### Definition
Maintenance of expected circulating blood volume and body fluid homeostasis of the patient (age dependent).

#### Importance
Maintenance of physiological body fluid homeostasis is important for normal organ function. Deviations from this equilibrium (hypo- and hypervolemia) are commonly encountered in the peri-operative period.

#### Consequences

#### Hypovolemia
-   results in hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia
-   hypovolemia is the leading cause of perioperative cardiac arrests (POCA) in children

#### Hypervolemia
-   dilutional coagulopathy
-   tissue edema

#### Prevention and treatment
-   preoperative clinical assessment (capillary refill time, urinary output) and correct preoperative disturbances if required
-   consider using other monitors which may include: invasive pressure monitoring, SvO2, repeated, periodical arterial blood gas analysis (acid base state) and non-invasive cardiac output monitors

#### Hypovolemia
-   avoid prolonged fasting times which can lead to hypovolemia
-   correct / minimize pre-operative deficits
-   sufficient IV access (size and number)
-   maintenance fluids
-   blood and coagulation management

#### Hypervolemia
-   close monitoring and control of fluid administration
-   correction of intraoperative coagulopathy

### Normotension (10Ns)

#### Definition
Maintenance of expected systemic blood pressure within a normal range of the patient (age dependent).
So far, the lower limits of acceptable perioperative blood pressure are suggested to be above the 5th percentile range of age dependent normal systolic blood pressure values. In premature neonates the mean arterial blood pressure should correspond to the post-conceptional age in weeks. However, there are no international consensus definitions of safe values of systemic blood pressure in children during anesthesia.

#### Importance
Deviations from patient specific norms may result in physiologically and clinically relevant impairments of organ and tissue perfusions.

#### Consequences
A significant change from pre-operatively measured systemic blood pressure values is frequently observed. Deviations can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and damage.

#### Prevention and treatment
Strive to achieve sufficient organ perfusion:
-   measure blood pressure correctly and promptly
-   measure blood pressure regularly and increase frequency when indicated
-   consider inaccuracy and limitations of non-invasive blood pressure measurements
-   maintain normovolemia and normal heart rate
-   appropriate dosing of drugs
-   compensate for sympathomimetic loss and consider use of vasoactive drugs
-   consider monitoring perfusion by alternative means
-   consider the potential inaccuracy and limitations of the measuring device and method
-   avoid large fluctuations of blood pressure
-   maintain normothermia, normocapnia and normoxia

### Normal Heart Rate (10Ns)

#### Definition
Maintenance of expected heart rate within a normal range of the patient (age dependent)

#### Importance
Autonomic control of the heart rate in utero is mediated predominantly via the parasympathetic nervous system. Just after birth the sympathetic control begins to appear, although the parasympathetic nervous system continues to dominate in childhood decreasing only in adolescence.
In neonates and infants, the heart rate may have a wide variation that is still within normal limits. The mean heart rate in neonates in the first 24 hours is 120 beats per minute, it increases to a mean of 160 beats per minute at 1 month of age, after which it gradually decreases to 75 beats per min at adolescence (Table 1).
In young children cardiac output is very much depended on heart rate and any heart rate \< 100 beats per minute should be explored further and treated if necessary.
In older children, a significant number of arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities are also encountered, with marked fluctuations in heart rate caused by variations in autonomic tone.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   **Age**   Mean heart rate in beats per minute (range)   ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------    Premature    120-170
   0-3 months   100-150
  3-6 months    90-120
   6-12 months   80-120
   1-3 years    70-110
    3-6 years   65-110
   6-12 years   60-95
    \> 12 years 55-85   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Table 1. The relationship between age and heart rate

#### Consequences
Acute deviations from patient specific norms may result in physiologically and clinically relevant impairments of organ and tissue perfusions

#### Prevention and treatment
Strive to achieve sufficient organ perfusion:
-   monitor heart rate appropriately
-   identify and treat underlying causes for bradycardia (hypoxemia, hypotension, drug errors, reflexes)
-   prepare / administer epinephrine and/ or anticholinergics
-   perform external cardiac compression in children if acute bradycardia (\< 60 bpm) and with signs of poor perfusion occurs

### Normoxemia (10Ns)

#### Definition
Normal oxygen tension in the blood. Adequate oxygen supply permits aerobic metabolism.

#### Importance
**Hypoxemia** is commonly encountered during pediatric anesthesia. Prolonged hypoxemia may lead to adverse short and long-term outcomes.
**Hyperoxemia** is iatrogenic and may result in the production of reactive oxygen species affecting normal organ function.

#### Consequences
Acute and chronic changes in oxygen tensions results in physiologically and clinically relevant tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

#### Hypoxemia
Hypoxemia may result in severe tissue hypoxia, bradycardia, cerebral and other organ hypoperfusion.

#### Hyperoxemia
Prolonged hyperoxemia may affect organ development and function such as retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

#### Prevention
-   aim to achieve adequate oxygen tensions
-   acute hypoxia is commonly a result of difficulties and critical incidences during airway and ventilation management
**Prevention requires:**
-   regular teaching and training
-   equipment and drugs
-   suitable staffing
-   assessment und preparation of patient
-   local algorithms for the (un)expected / risky airway difficulties should be established.
-   establish regulation for delivery of adequate FiO2 and ventilation management

### Normocapnia (10Ns)

#### Definition
Maintenance of expected arterial carbon dioxide tension.

#### Importance
Blood arterial carbon dioxide tensions are modified during anesthesia. Changes in arterial carbon dioxide tensions significantly affect body homeostasis including the acid-base status, the sympathomimetic tone and organ blood flow.

#### Consequences
Acute and chronic changes in arterial carbon dioxide tensions lead to short- and long-term outcomes:
-   modulation of vasoreactivity
-   central nervous system damage
-   neuro-behavioral changes

#### Prevention and treatment
-   aim to achieve adequate carbon dioxide tensions
-   acute changes in carbon dioxide tensions are commonly a result of difficulties and critical incidences during airway and ventilation management.
**Prevention requires:**
-   regular teaching and training of ventilation strategies
-   consider limitations of monitoring and airway equipment
-   use cuffed endotracheal tubes if appropriate
-   recognize discrepancies between arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide tensions
-   Establish regulation for delivery of adequate ventilation management
-   Avoid acute high amplitude fluctuations of arterial carbon dioxide tension

### Normonatremia (10Ns)

#### Definition
Normal plasma sodium concentration within the age specific range.

#### Importance
Plasma sodium is the major determinant of serum osmolality and therefore extracellular fluid volume. It is also a major determinant of neuronal excitability. Acute perioperative changes in plasma sodium concentrations are a leading cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality in children.

#### Consequences
-   acute and severe hyponatremia may result in neurological damage and death (cerebral edema, seizures, transtentorial herniation)
-   rapid correction of hyponatremia may result in pontine myelinolysis.

#### Prevention and treatment
-   consider the need for prolonged parenteral fluid administration
-   use balanced isotonic solutions
-   regular perioperative assessment sodium if continuous fluid therapy
-   avoid acute fluctuations of plasma sodium concentrations

### Normoglycemia (10Ns)

#### Definition
Normal blood glucose concentration within the age specific normal range.

#### Importance
Blood glucose homeostasis is important for ensuring a continuing energy supply and stable plasma osmolality. Small infants have reduced glycogen storage capacity and hence have a limited ability to maintain blood glucose concentrations during periods of fasting.

#### Consequences
Acute and chronic changes in blood glucose concentrations have significant consequences to the perioperative outcome.

#### Hypoglycemia
-   irritability
-   seizures
-   hemodynamic instability
-   coma, death

#### Hyperglycemia
-   hyperosmolality
-   ketoacidosis
-   polyuria and dehydration and
-   seizures, death

#### Prevention and treatment
-   awareness of fasting and nutrition status of the patient, minimize preoperative fasting times
-   perioperative (surgical) stress reduction (analgesia and body temperature control)
-   situation appropriate monitoring (neonates, critically ill children) and investigations
-   consider isotonic glucose containing perioperative intravenous solutions especially in preterm, neonates and small infants, patient on total parental nutrition (TPN) and critically ill patients
-   patients with inherited and acquired endocrine or glucose dependent metabolic disorders require special attention and workup
-   prompt and appropriate treatment of significant hypo- and hyperglycemia

### Normothermia (10Ns)

#### Definition
Body temperature within the normal physiological range

#### Importance and Consequences
**Hypothermia** is a common problem in children exposed to anesthetic drugs -- especially in the youngest age groups. Hypothermia during anesthesia has many harmful consequences and may trigger multiple physiological changes (increased metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, prolonged bleeding time and increased risk for postoperative infection) and influence the pharmacokinetic and --dynamics of anesthetics.
**Hyperthermia** most commonly occurs because of iatrogenic overheating and failure to decrease the temperature of the exogenous heat source in the face of an increasingly body temperature. Other causes of hyperthermia include malignant hyperthermia, thyrotoxicosis and sepsis.

#### Prevention and Treatment
Temperature can be monitored in the axilla, bladder, nasopharynx, esophagus, rectum, tympanic membrane and the skin. Core temperature is most accurately measured on the tympanic membrane or the esophagus.
Core temperature monitoring should be monitored in procedures lasting more than 30 min with an effort to maintain temperature \> 36°C. External forced-air warming should be used to prevent hypothermia. Ambient temperature should be maintained between 21°and 26°C with a relative humidity level of 40-60%. IV solutions should be considered warmed to 38°C in high risk cases.

### No Postoperative Discomfort

### No Pain (10Ns)
It refers to the concept No Postoperative Discomfort

#### Definition
Unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such.

#### Importance
A large number of children still experience significant pain in the perioperative period. Poor pain control remains a significant problem following hospital discharge.

#### Consequences
Inadequate peri-operative pain control can lead to a variety of behavioral and somatic changes.
**These include:**
-   altered behavior (emotional)
-   subsequent altered pain perception
-   prolonged hospital stays and increased re-admission rates
-   chronic pain
-   negative parental perception
-   social consequences

#### Good Practice Points
-   regularly assess pain in all children to "make pain visible"
-   chart pain as a vital sign
-   ensure clear appropriate protocols to bring pain scores down and to maintain low pain scores
-   reassess pain after analgesic interventions to ensure efficacy and to minimize side effects (titration)
-   use multimodal analgesia and opioid-sparing techniques where possible and as appropriate
-   ensure continuing analgesia at home

#### Follow-Up/ Outcome
-   audit pain assessments, high pain scores and pain at home and plan QI initiatives
-   audit adverse effects, critical incidents and drug errors and make plans to reduce incidence

### No PONV (10Ns)

#### Definition
The term PONV is used to describe nausea and/ or vomiting or retching in the immediate 24 postoperative hours.

#### Importance
Children undergoing anesthesia and surgery are at high risk for PONV. PONV leads to additional discomfort, morbidity and costs.

#### Consequences
PONV is an unpleasant experience resulting in a variety of significant consequences which include:
-   additional burden for the child, parents, clinician and nurses
-   increased postoperative morbidity, pain, dehydration and surgical complications
-   delayed discharge and increased re-admission
-   additional medication and increased workload

#### Good Practice Points
-   assess risk factors from patient history, type of surgery and type of anesthesia
-   establish local standard operating protocols for the prevention and treatment of PONV according to current evidence-based guidelines (see below)
-   be aware of factors unrelated to current condition which could cause or exacerbate PONV (intestinal, brain, hypotension, allergic reaction, drug side effects)

#### Follow-Up/ Outcome
-   audit incidence and severity of PONV
-   audit use of antiemetic protocols and compliance with protocols
-   QI initiatives to reduce in-hospital and post-discharge PONV

#### Key references
-   "This is the 2nd edition of the APAGBI evidence-based guidelines on prevention of postoperative vomiting in children from 2016.

### No Emergence Delirium (10Ns)

#### Definition
Emergence delirium is part of an early negative postoperative behavior. It is an abnormal mental state following anesthesia and surgery and separate to pain.

#### Importance
Emergence delirium is common following general anesthesia in young children. Effective recognition and treatment is essential to reduce self-inflicted injuries and improve satisfaction of parents and caregivers.

#### Consequences
Emergence delirium may result in self-injury of the child and increase the healthcare requirements:
-   emergence delirium reduces parental and caregivers' satisfaction
-   short- and long-term psychological implications of emergence delirium are unclear
-   children with emergence delirium may have a higher risk of developing separation anxiety, apathy, and sleep and eating disorders

#### Good practice points
-   be aware of risk factors and triggers
-   ensure appropriate information for child and parents is given in advance
-   effective local standardized protocols for prevention, recognition and treatment including non-drug treatment and involvement of parents in recovery process after anesthesia
