## Normoxemia (10Ns)

### Definition
Normal oxygen tension in the blood. Adequate oxygen supply permits aerobic metabolism.

### Importance

**Hypoxemia*- is commonly encountered during pediatric anesthesia. Prolonged hypoxemia may lead to adverse short and long-term outcomes.

**Hyperoxemia*- is iatrogenic and may result in the production of reactive oxygen species affecting normal organ function.

### Consequences
Acute and chronic changes in oxygen tensions results in physiologically and clinically relevant tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

#### Hypoxemia
Hypoxemia may result in severe tissue hypoxia, bradycardia, cerebral and other organ hypoperfusion.

#### Hyperoxemia
Prolonged hyperoxemia may affect organ development and function such as retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

### Prevention
- aim to achieve adequate oxygen tensions
- acute hypoxia is commonly a result of difficulties and critical incidences during airway and ventilation management

**Prevention requires:**

- regular teaching and training
- equipment and drugs
- suitable staffing
- assessment und preparation of patient
- local algorithms for the (un)expected / risky airway difficulties should be established.
- establish regulation for delivery of adequate FiO2 and ventilation management
