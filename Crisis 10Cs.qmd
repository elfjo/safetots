Critical events in pediatric anesthesia are common (up to 10% of all children) and can lead to morbidity and mortality.

Essential Standard Operating Protocols (SOP) in addition to education, teaching and training are necessary for the prevention, prompt recognition and appropriate treatment of critical situations.

The instant availability of essential drugs, equipment and support staff is required in addition to these SOPs. The most common acute and life-threatening complications require intuitive, clear and goal directed SOPs.

Below are examples of the ten most common life-threatening critical situations and approaches in pediatric anesthesia care.
- Can´t Oxygenate -- Can´t Ventilate
- Can´t Intubate
- Can Intubate -- Can't Oxygenate
- Can´t Cannulate -- Failed Venous Access
- Anaphylaxis
- Major Haemorrhage
- Perioperative Pulmonary Aspiration
- Tonsillar Bleeding
- Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity -- LAST
- Malignant Hyperthermia Crisis -- MH

###  Can´t Oxygenate-Ventilate (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

#### Summary
Can't oxygenate-ventilate situations in children are common and are usually due to functional and/or anatomical airway obstructions. Early recognition and treatment with appropriate skills, equipment and drugs can overcome these situations in otherwise healthy children.

#### Background
- most common complication with potential serious morbidity and mortality
- most frequent complication in otherwise healthy children
- often associated with lack of skills, knowledge, education, training, experience and the use of age inappropriate equipment
- infants and toddlers at particular risk
- high risk surgeries (ENT)

#### Prevention

#### Identify children at risk
- the child with acute airway infection, bronchial hyperactivity, asthma, allergic predisposition
- premature, neonates, infants and toddlers
- history, signs and symptoms predictive for difficult airway
- obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)
- acquired and congenital airway abnormalities and diseases

#### Strict transfer policy regarding children at risk

#### Seek experienced consultation and help early

#### Infrastructure and competence
Anesthesia for children should be undertaken or supervised by anesthetists who have undergone appropriate education, training and experience
- suitable anesthesia environment
- appropriate patient positioning
- basic age specific airway equipment
- appropriate depth of anesthesia
- immediate access to emergency drugs (prepared)
- pre-oxygenation as appropriate and accepted by patient

#### Treatment
- recognize and treat anatomical/mechanical airway obstruction
- call for help early
- recognize and treat functional airway obstruction
- exclude and treat foreign body airway obstruction
- perform endotracheal intubation / insert laryngeal mask airway
- (Can't oxygenate, can't intubate (COCI) -- invasive oxygenation/ ventilation via front of neck airway)
- Post Care
- debriefing is essential (patient, parent, staff)
- ensure good documentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet)

###  Can´t Intubate (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

#### Summary
Skills and in-depth knowledge are essential. It is important to recognize airway abnormalities before any airway manipulation. Call for help early if doubts about the ability to ventilate exist. Limit the tracheal intubation attempts and always consider a supraglottic airway as an alternative.

#### Background
- the trachea of the vast majority of children is usually easy to intubate
- patients do not come to harm because they cannot be intubated but are harmed because of repeated attempts to intubate their trachea
- often associated with lack of skills, knowledge, education, training, experience and use of age inappropriate equipment
- infants and toddlers are at particular risk
- Prevention

#### Identify children at risk
- children aged \<1 year (unfamiliar anatomy and limited experience)
- previous difficult intubation
- craniofacial deformities and facial dysmorphia
- airway abnormalities associated with genetic syndromes and diseases
- acquired abnormalities (burns, contractures, hardware)
- Strict transfer policy regarding children at risk

#### Seek experienced consultation and help early

#### Infrastructure and competence
Anesthesia for children should be undertaken or supervised by anesthetists who have undergone appropriate education, training and experience
- suitable anesthesia environment
- appropriate patient positioning
- basic age specific airway equipment
- adequate depth of anesthesia and muscle paralysis
- use of appropriate technique including external laryngeal manipulation
- pre-oxygenation as appropriate and accepted by patient

#### Treatment
- limit initial tracheal intubation attempts to maximum 2 attempts
- maintain oxygenation, ventilation and anesthesia at all times.
- consider indication for intubation and possibility to use supraglottic airway or face mask only
- alternative airway technique or operator according to local expertise
- insert supraglottic airway for emergency situations or for awakening of patient for postponing the procedure

#### Post Care
- debriefing (patient, parent, staff)
- documentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet)

###  Can Intubate -- Can't Oxygenate (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

#### Summary
Persistent post-intubation hypoxia can rapidly lead to morbidity and even mortality. Early recognition and effective intervention using a structured approach is required.

#### Background
- small children have short and narrow airways requiring small and fragile airway equipment
- obstruction and dislocation of airway devices are common during moving and positioning
- gastric distension significantly reduces functional residual capacity in small children and may considerably impair ventilation and gas exchange
- limited oxygenation and respiratory reserves in small children result in rapid development of hypoxemia, carbon dioxide accumulation and respiratory acidosis. High closing capacity in small children increases likelihood of pulmonary atelectasis leading to intra-pulmonary shunt and hypoxemia
- rapid administration of potent opioids may lead to thoracic rigidity
- pediatric patients are at higher risk for bronchial hyper-reactivity particularly those with respiratory infection, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or allergic diathesis
- congenital and acquired diseases may affect lower airway patency or can lead to an acute tracheal tube obstruction

#### Prevention
- correct positioning of tracheal tube and safe, effective fixation of airway devices is paramount
- suitable and careful positioning and moving of patients with tracheal tube. Reassess proper position of airway devices after re-positioning.
- ensure stable position when oral procedures (ENT, cleft surgery, gastroenterology, cardiology (transesophageal echocardiography) are performed
- ensure adequate depth of anesthesia (+/- muscle paralysis)
- perform appropriate ventilation and recruitment strategies
- consider gastric decompression following airway manoeuvres
- children with copious secretions or pus are at risk of tracheal tube obstruction and patency requires regular checking and confirmation

#### Treatment
- call for assistance, if in doubt -- take it out
- the acronym DOPES summarizes the most relevant immediately life-threatening causes and interventions that effectively treat the 'Can Intubate -- Can't Ventilate' situation
- Exclude and treat
- **D** -- Displacement of tracheal tube (endobronchial, esophageal and pharyngeal)
- **O** -- Obstruction of tracheal tube, respiratory valves or respiratory filter with secretion and functional airway obstructions (severe bronchospasm, opioids)
- **P** -- Pneumothorax
- **E** -- Equipment problems (disconnection, kinking of respiratory tubing)
- **S** -- Stomach & Specials (increased intra-abdominal pressure, pulmonary pathology, pulmonary-arterial hypertension, cardiac right-to-left shunts, alveolar collapse)

#### Post Care
- debriefing is essential (patient, parent, staff)
- documentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet) if appropriate
- follow--up if and when required

###  Can´t Cannulate -- Failed Venous Access (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

#### Summary
Intra-osseous access is the access of choice in life threatening emergencies

#### Background
- venous access in children can be difficult resulting in multiple attempts and may fail
- delays in obtaining venous access can result in morbidity particularly during emergencies
- those most at risk are young children, the chronically ill, obese or premature infants
- intra-osseous access has no reported associated mortality in contrast to emergency central venous access

#### Prevention
- careful clinical evaluation and preparation (patient, team, equipment and environment)
- maintain hydration (short fasting times)
- use topical anesthesia for awake cannulation

#### Treatment
- use the vein you can see
- call for assistance
- failed conventional venous puncture may require alternative venous access techniques (ultrasound, vein light, vein viewer or others) and operator
- intra-osseous access is the access of choice in life threatening emergencies

#### Post Care
- ensure secure taping of successful venous access
- consider establishing longterm central venous access (PICC, port, Broviac, Hickmann lines)

###  Anaphylaxis (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

#### Summary
- anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening, generalized or systemic hypersensitivity reaction
- anaphylaxis is very rare in children but requires swift and effective recognition and treatment

#### Background
- severe anaphylactic reactions in children are rare
- main triggers are antibiotics, colloids, hypnotics, muscle relaxants, intravenous contrast and latex
- prompt recognition and early treatment is required to avoid morbidity and mortality

#### Prevention
- take careful patient history
- high index of suspicion if severe hypotension and/or bronchospasm occurs
- knowledge of potential cross-reactivity
- eliminate potential triggers (latex free environment)
- ensure availability of effective drug treatments
- alternative diagnosis: Intestinal eventration syndrome, local anesthetic systemic toxicity

#### Treatment
- call for help
- stop the triggering agent
- give epinephrine 10 micrograms/kg IM, repeat iv as required
- give epinephrine IV (1-2-3-5-10 micrograms/kg) titrated according to effect
- maintain/ establish airway, give high flow oxygen, monitor vital signs
- consider raising legs/ fluid challenge if hypotension
- give antihistamines and steroids

#### Post Care
- take three timed blood samples for serum tryptase (as soon as possible, 1-2 hours and \>24h after event)
- develop urgent management plan according to clinical needs
- monitor patient carefully in the postoperative period
- provide patient letter and letter to family physician
- arrange referral to allergy clinic

###  Major Hemorrhage (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

#### Summary
Major perioperative hemorrhage is the leading cause of severe morbidity and mortality in children and its successful management requires close co-operation with the surgical team.

#### Background
Unexpected major surgical hemorrhage is the leading cause for perioperative cardiac arrests in children. Morbidity and mortality during major hemorrhage is related to insufficient venous access, inadequate monitoring, underestimation of blood loss, lack of control of clotting and access to blood products.

#### Prevention
- know your patient
- know your surgeon and intended procedure
- smart choice of number and type of vascular access and monitoring
- maintain normovolemia, look for signs of hypovolemia (capillary refill time, arterial pulse wave)
- consider clotting and hemostasis
- be prepared for the unexpected sudden blood loss (fluids, blood, equipment for intraosseous access, epinephrine)

#### Treatment
- early call for help and additional resources
- determine cause, collaborate with surgeon (tamponade/ embolization/ cross clamping)
- consider additional venous or intra-osseous access as required
- give fluids/volume
- catecholamines
- consider tranexamic acid
- monitor hemostasis repeatedly -\> laboratory, viscoelastic testing (e.g. ROTEM, TEG)
- order and give blood products and clotting factors as indicated
- consult with hematologist and intensivist
- consider and exclude other reasons for hemodynamic instability (cardiologist)

#### Post Care
- re-establish normovolemia and hemostasis
- delayed extubation (PICU)
- careful documentation
- follow-up
- patient disclosure and debriefing

###  Perioperative Pulmonary Aspiration (10Cs)

#### Summary
Perioperative pulmonary aspiration is a rare event provided that the airway technique and device has been selected according to the patient risk factors.

#### Background
Peri-operative pulmonary aspiration is rare in pediatric anesthesia and usually has a good outcome.

#### Prevention
- strict adherence to fasting instructions and recognition of patients with delayed gastric emptying or with a full stomach
- patients with intestinal obstruction require a naso-gastric tube
- choice of appropriate induction technique and airway device
- controlled Rapid Sequence Induction and Intubation (RSII) requires rapid induction of anesthesia, deep muscle relaxation and gentle face mask ventilation to maintain oxygenation, ventilation and anesthesia
- ensure sufficient depth of anesthesia (+/- muscle relaxation) to avoid coughing, bucking, straining resulting in regurgitation of gastric content and pulmonary aspiration

#### Treatment
- call for assistance and help
- place patient in lateral and head down position
- suction clearance of airway content and secure airway with tracheal intubation
- no broncho-alveolar lavage
- solid foreign body aspiration may require bronchoscopy and extraction
- lung recruitment maneuver if required
- postpone non-emergency surgery if severe aspiration suspected
- chest x-ray, steroids or prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely required unless symptoms persist
- attempt early extubation

#### Post Care
- hospital discharge is possible if asymptomatic after 2 hours

###  Tonsillar Bleeding (10Cs)

#### Summary
A common potentially life-threatening emergency in children that requires a standardized and effective, locally agreed hospital approach.

#### Background
Post-tonsillectomy bleeding occurs in up to 5% of all tonsillectomies with 50% surgical revision. Mortality occurs in up to 1:30 000 patients usually due to delayed intervention. Anesthetic challenges are hypovolemia, difficult airway (bleeding and swelling), full stomach (blood) and difficult venous access.

#### Prevention
- patients require fluid resuscitation prior to induction of anesthesia unless the rate of bleeding exceeds the ability to replacement volume
- early intravenous/ intra-osseous access is required
- a hospital care pathway needs to be established with all team members (emergency physicians, anesthetist, surgeon and nurse) work from the same instructions, precise lines of communication, information required and clinical guidance to achieve the optimal care
- must have a pre-defined role in this scenario
- anticipate a difficult tracheal intubation
- prepare adequate airway equipment and drugs
- two suction sources available

#### Treatment
- controlled Rapid Sequence Induction and Intubation with gentle face mask ventilation following induction of anesthesia and securing the airway with a cuffed tracheal tube is used to avoid severe hypoxemia
- evaluate intraoperative hemostasis
- empty stomach using an oro-gastric (placed by surgeon under direct vision) prior to extubation
- ensure hemostasis proper surgical revision before extubation of the awake and hemodynamically stable patient
- Post Care
- consider delayed extubation in case of severe bleeding, unstable patient or unclear coagulation
- consider tranexamic acid in severe tonsillar bleeding
- consider referral to hematologist if hereditary coagulation order is suspected

###  Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity -- LAST (10Cs)

#### Summary
Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) in children can be prevented by slow injection of local anesthetic agents and careful monitoring for clinical signs. Primary treatment is directed to maintaining oxygenation and circulation before initiating lipid rescue.

#### Background
- local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) occurs when large quantities of local anesthetics reach the systemic circulation and depends on multiple variables and presents in various clinical ways ranging from mild neurological symptoms to cardiac toxicity and death
- early symptoms and signs of LAST are masked in children if regional anesthesia is administered during general anesthesia and sedation
- cardiac toxicity of local anesthetics is increased by acidosis and hypoxemia

#### Prevention
- knowledge of maximum dose and concentration is essential and it is important to individualize the choice of drug, dose and concentration based on the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities
- the 'Stop before you block' principle allows checking of patient relevant information, dose, contra-indication and type and site of regional anesthesia before injection local anesthetics
- careful aspiration, passive back-flow, slow injection, test dose with added epinephrine (1:200,000) and close hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure in 1-minute intervals, pulse oximetry and ECG) allows early detection of inadvertent systemic administration and avoidance of LAST
- confirm maximum dose of continuous administration local anesthetic for neonates and infants as well older children
- ensure availability of:

- Resuscitative equipment and drugs
- Airway equipment: the means to provide bag mask ventilation, oral and nasal airways, laryngoscopes and endotracheal tubes, laryngeal mask airways

#### Treatment
- when suspecting LAST, stop injecting more local anesthetic and call for help
- supportive measures to maintain the airway and oxygenation and treating seizures are usually sufficient
- maintaining cardiac output using epinephrine and external cardiac massage if necessary results in re-distribution and clearance of the local anesthetic
- secondary administration of lipid solutions may be useful in severe cases and hasten recovery from LAST

#### Post Care
- patient disclosure and careful documentation are required
- if an allergic reaction is considered arrange further workup and follow-up

###  Malignant Hyperthermia Crisis -- MH (10Cs)

#### Summary
Malignant hyperthermia crisis occurs in response to volatile anesthetic agents and depolarizing muscle relaxants (suxamethonium). Prevention and immediate treatment with dantrolene is life-saving.

#### Background
- malignant hyperthermia is a life-threatening metabolic response to volatile anesthetic agents or succinylcholine (suxamethonium). Previous uneventful exposure to these agents does not guarantee safe use
- mortality may approach 70% if untreated, with dantrolene treatment mortality approximates 3-5%

#### Prevention
- recognition of patients at risk through careful medical and family history and/ or consultation with specialist Malignant Hyperthermia reference center
- do not use volatiles or succinylcholine (suxamethonium) in patients at risk
- reduce preoperative anxiety
- use a vapor free anesthetic machine if possible, if not available prepare machine according to manufacturer's guidelines and use a new breathing circuit, rebreathing bag, and gas sampling tubes
- consider vapor scavenging filters
- ensure dantrolene availability

#### Treatment
Call for help early, initiate action plan and allocate specific tasks:

- stop potential trigger agents immediately and give 100% oxygen
- consider installing clean breathing system, remove inhalational agents and increase fresh gas flow to maximum, consider vapor scavenging filters
- hyperventilate to achieve normocapnia
- maintain anesthesia using non-volatile anesthetics and opioids as well as non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, curtail surgery if possible
- give dantrolene (2.5mg/kg every 5 minutes until effect -- max. 20mg/kg): need to assign one person to correctly reconstitute dantrolene from powder formulation
- active cooling
- treat or prevent hyperkalemia, acidosis, arrhythmias (no calcium channel antagonists) and prevent acute renal failure and coagulopathy
- continuous monitoring of vital signs including peripheral and core temperature, invasive monitoring for repeated blood sampling
- check plasma CK

#### Post Care
- continue monitoring postoperatively on PICU, repeat dantrolene as required
- repeat plasma CK
- monitor and prevent acute renal failure and compartment syndrome
- counsel patient and family members
- arrange referral to Malignant Hyperthermia Unit
