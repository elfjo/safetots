## The Safetots Mission and Story

### Story

**Laboratory research over the past 2 decades has raised concerns*- about the effects of anesthesia and surgery in the developing brain.

**There is a controversy if neuromorbidity*- may result from the potentially toxic effects of anesthetic drugs on the central nervous system or may arise from an inappropriate conduct of anesthesia and from surgery.

**The SmartTots public-private partnership*- focuses on studying the harmful effects of anesthetics on the developing brain.

**The Safetots.org initiative was established to emphasize the role of the conduct of anesthesia*- to prevent harm in the perioperative period and to promote safe and high quality clinical care. This initiative considers that the quality of anesthesia management and other well-known risk factors of perioperative care have a far more important impact on outcomes following anesthesia and surgery.

**The Safetots.org initiative aims to bring together healthcare providers*- in the field of pediatric perioperative care.

## Rights of the Child (10Rs)
![A close-up of a child Description automatically generated](media/image3.png){width="5.508333333333334in" height="2.6909722222222223in"}
Children's rights are human rights. In 1989 the United Nations declared the Convention of the Rights of Children \[1\], promoting the rights and the protection of children to develop their full potential, free from hunger and want, neglect and abuse.
Article 24 of the UN's Convention of the Rights of Children addresses the rights and the special demands of children in health care institutions recognizing that children are especially vulnerable.

The EACH Charter (1988)3 recognizes and endorses the rights of the child as stipulated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and in particular the key principle that, in all situations, the best interests of the child should prevail (art.3).
As commitment to the Convention of the Rights of Children and The EACH Charter the Safetots.org initiative adjusted this to the perioperative situation and issued the following 10 Rights (10 R).

### Right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health
"Children have the right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health. Specialist pediatric anesthesia care should be provided for all children. Particularly children aged less than three years should be treated by experienced staff that follows continuous education, regular training and updates to maintain their competencies. Children who have significant co-morbidity and those who requiring highly specialized or major surgery benefit from specialized anesthetic care in dedicated pediatric centers." \[1\]

### Right to non-discrimination
"All children should be treated in a respectful and empathic way, whatever their race, religion or abilities; whatever they think or say, whatever type of family they come from. It doesn't matter where children live, what language they speak, what their parents do, whether they are boys or girls, what their culture is, whether they have a disability or whether they are rich or poor. No child should be treated unfairly on any basis." \[1\]

### Right to be protected from economic exploitation
"Children need to be protected from any economic exploitation in health care. Profit-motivated treatment of children in hospitals and medical institutions of low quality should be avoided." \[3\]

### Right to be protected from unnecessary treatment and investigation
"Children need to be protected from unnecessary treatment and investigation. That includes any potential harm and burden associated with their involvement in research, teaching or training of medical staff." \[3\]

### Right to avoid pain, fear and stress
"All children should be treated without suffering from pain, fear and unnecessary stress. They should benefit from all forms of anesthesia and procedural sedation whenever they or their caregivers ask for. Children should have full access to pain therapy and palliative care." \[3\]
Some pain, fear and stress may be inevitable but all efforts should be undertaken to minimize this.

### Right to have their parents with them
"Children have the right to have their parents with them during the induction of anesthesia and during recovery." \[3\]
Although this may not always be possible or appropriate, the view of the child and the caregiver should always be taken into account.

### Right to privacy
"The privacy of children should be respected at all times during induction and maintenance of anesthesia and recovery. This includes also: protection against exposure during physical examinations and personal, hygiene activities, e.g. dressing, toileting and bathing; protection against treatment and behaviour which diminishes self-respect or makes the child feel ridiculous or humiliated." \[3\]

### Right to be informed
"Children and adolescents have the right to information on all aspects of health which enables them to make informed choices. They have the right to get and share information about treatment and procedures during anesthesia, sedation and pain-therapy in a manner appropriate to age and understanding as long as the information is not damaging to them or others. Participation in decision making requires advance information about all measures that need to be taken." \[3\]

### Right to be heard
"Children have the right to be heard and to express their wishes, concerns and fears. According to age, understanding and level of development they have the right to be involved in and contribute to the medical decision-making process in anesthesia, sedation and pain-therapy." \[3\]

### Right to be cared for together with children who have the same developmental needs
"Children have the right to receive treatment during anesthesia, sedation and pain-therapy in a child-friendly environment where they can enjoy emotional and physical stimulation suited to their age and condition. These measures help to minimize anxiety and normalize what can be an abnormal situation." \[3\]

## Competence (5Ws)
![A group of people in scrubs working on a baby Description automatically generated](media/image4.png){width="5.508333333333334in" height="2.935416666666667in"}
The 5Ws listed below are closely related to the Rights of the Child (10Rs). In particular children have

- the "Right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health"
- the "Right to avoid pain, fear and stress"
- the "Right to have their parents with them"
- These basic rights are respected if the 5Ws are applied.

### Who

**Anesthesia for children should always be delivered by competent and appropriately experienced anesthesiologists and care teams.**
Children aged less than 3 years, ASA physical status ≥ III (all ages), with underlying congenital and metabolic diseases and/or those undergoing major or complex surgery are those at highest risk for perioperative complications and poor outcome. It is recommended that these children should receive care by an anesthesiologist with specific education, training and ongoing experience in pediatric anesthesia.

**Anesthesiologists with mixed practice can deliver pediatric anesthesia for healthy children aged \>3 years simple and routine procedures*- provided they have the adequate expertise and regular practice in pediatric anesthesia. They should maintain their competence with regular exposure to pediatric lists and keep their knowledge up-to-date. This will minimize the occurrence of life-threatening complications.

**Continuing education and regular updates*- in pediatric centers are recommended to maintain competency. Specialist centers should support those in non-specialist practice.

**Residents and fellows in pediatric anesthesia departments*- must be supervised in a 1:1 manner by experienced staff during induction and emergence as well as at any time during the anesthesia if required.

### Where
Children should receive pediatric anesthesia care in children's hospitals or in general/district hospitals with dedicated pediatric areas.

#### Regionalization of pediatric anesthesia
The pediatric population is too small to allow maintenance of sufficient skills for every anesthesiologist. Care of children undergoing anesthesia should ideally be regionalized in specialized pediatric settings staffed by pediatric anesthesiologists and pediatric nurses.
In particular, the most vulnerable pediatric population, such as neonates and infants, those with co-morbidities and with underlying congenital and metabolic diseases as well as children undergoing major or complex surgery require referral to appropriately resourced multidisciplinary pediatric environments.

#### Advantages of specialized children's hospitals 

- 24/7 pediatric anesthesia emergency service
- Specialized pediatric nursing staff
- Appropriate equipment for daily routine and critical situations for all targeted age groups
- Development and implementation of standard operating protocols (SOP) for routine processes and crisis situations
- Pediatric pain service
- Pediatric Intensive Care provision

#### District hospitals providing pediatric anesthesia care
Anesthesia for elective routine operations in otherwise stable and healthy children can be performed in district hospitals by teams with sufficient expertise in pediatric anesthesia. This requires appropriate staffing, equipment, facilities and support services.
Out of hours and emergency care must be provided by a team with sufficient expertise in pediatric anesthesia in a suitable environment with clear operational policies.

#### Remote Areas and the Critically Ill Child
Children who undergo anesthesia in remote areas (imaging, interventional procedures, dental suites and other special facilities) and who require deep sedation or general anesthesia must receive the same standard of care.
An effective referral and retrieval system must be in place for the transfer of critical ill children.

### What

**Pediatric patients requiring highly specialized or major surgery*- (cardiac, thoracic, major visceral, major orthopedic, neurosurgical, burns and craniofacial procedures), those with significant and uncontrolled co-morbidities as well as critically ill children will benefit from specialized anesthetic care in dedicated pediatric centers.

**Anesthesia for routine operations*- (common ENT/ORL procedures, simple fractures, wound repairs, laparoscopic appendectomy) in otherwise stable and healthy children can be performed in district hospitals by specialist pediatric anesthesiologists or anesthesiologists with an expertise in pediatric anesthesia provided appropriate staffing, equipment, facilities and support services are in place.

### When
Careful considerations must be given to balance the increased perioperative risks for newborns and infants and the impact of delaying elective procedures/diagnostics for the well-being of the child.
A delay in elective or scheduled procedures may result in avoidable emergency procedures, which do carry a higher peri-operative risk.

### HoW
**High Quality and Safe Anesthesia Care*- promotes the well-being of the child (see Rights of the Child). It maintains physiological homeostasis (see 10Ns) and addresses the known peri-operative risk factors (See 10Cs) in an appropriately resourced multidisciplinary pediatric environment.

**Expertise in all pediatric anesthetic techniques*- is required to provide optimal care for all children in all situations. Several European countries have well established 'pediatric anesthesia fellowships' with the duration of one or two years.

**This is a mandatory prerequisite for those anesthesiologists*- that are willing to provide specialized pediatric care. In countries where a pediatric fellowship program is not established, the European Training Requirements (ETR) should be considered.

## No Fear (10Ns)

### Definition
Fear: Unpleasant emotion caused by an actual or perceived threat, danger, pain, loss or harm.

### Importance
Preoperative anxiety in children may result from the fear of pain, unfamiliar surroundings, a sense of loss of control, the presence of strangers, parental anxiety and many other perceived threats to their world. Some children will openly say they are frightened; others will cry, withdraw, cling to their parents or become agitated.

### Consequences
- anxiety may reduce cooperation; contribute to emergence delirium and increase pain and behavioral disturbances (sleep disturbances or nightmares, enuresis, separation anxiety and increased fear of doctors) after surgery
- up to 50% of children will still have these disturbances two weeks after surgery and some several months
- the incidence is increased after a stormy anesthetic induction and can be reduced if premedication or other strategies are used to reduce preoperative anxiety

### Prevention and treatment
There are 3 strategies that can be used to reduce or moderate anxiety:

- age-appropriate psychological preparation/ education (e.g. verbal or written information, video, mobile phone app or tablet-pc, hospital tours and role playing)
- parental presence (can be stressful to some parents)
- pharmacological premedication (benzodiazepines, α2-agonists, ketamine)

### Special situations and challenges
- the apprehensive child
- the combative child
- refusal
- parental anxiety and expectations

### No Awareness (10Ns)

### Definition
Postoperative recall of sensory perception during general anesthesia (no consensus definition available).

### Importance
- intraoperative awareness is more common in children (0.5-1.0%) compared to adults (0.1-0.2%)
- it may occur in non-paralyzed children without signs of inadequate anesthesia
- does not seem to be associated with distress or post-traumatic stress disorders
- the reasons for the high incidence in children are not known

### Consequences
- unknown, may have major implications on social life

**Risk factors include**
- drugs (neuromuscular blockade, thiopental, TIVA)
- patients (female gender, age (younger adults), obesity, previous awareness, possibly difficult airway management)
- subspecialties (obstetric, trauma, cardio-thoracic, neurosurgical)
- organizational (out-of-hours surgery, junior anesthetist)

### Prevention
- identify risk factors
- proper information preoperatively
- consider the use of neuro-monitoring in patients with risk factors -- particularly if previous awareness

### Treatment
- administer benzodiazepines if awareness is suspected
- if serious psychological problems occur (flash-backs, nightmares, new anxiety states and depression) the child should be referred to psychological service

## Normovolemia (10Ns)

### Definition
Maintenance of expected circulating blood volume and body fluid homeostasis of the patient (age dependent).

### Importance
Maintenance of physiological body fluid homeostasis is important for normal organ function. Deviations from this equilibrium (hypo- and hypervolemia) are commonly encountered in the peri-operative period.

### Consequences

#### Hypovolemia
- results in hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia
- hypovolemia is the leading cause of perioperative cardiac arrests (POCA) in children

#### Hypervolemia
- dilutional coagulopathy
- tissue edema

### Prevention and treatment
- preoperative clinical assessment (capillary refill time, urinary output) and correct preoperative disturbances if required
- consider using other monitors which may include: invasive pressure monitoring, SvO2, repeated, periodical arterial blood gas analysis (acid base state) and non-invasive cardiac output monitors

#### Hypovolemia
- avoid prolonged fasting times which can lead to hypovolemia
- correct / minimize pre-operative deficits
- sufficient IV access (size and number)
- maintenance fluids
- blood and coagulation management

#### Hypervolemia
- close monitoring and control of fluid administration
- correction of intraoperative coagulopathy

## Normotension (10Ns)

### Definition
Maintenance of expected systemic blood pressure within a normal range of the patient (age dependent).
So far, the lower limits of acceptable perioperative blood pressure are suggested to be above the 5th percentile range of age dependent normal systolic blood pressure values. In premature neonates the mean arterial blood pressure should correspond to the post-conceptional age in weeks. However, there are no international consensus definitions of safe values of systemic blood pressure in children during anesthesia.

### Importance
Deviations from patient specific norms may result in physiologically and clinically relevant impairments of organ and tissue perfusions.

### Consequences
A significant change from pre-operatively measured systemic blood pressure values is frequently observed. Deviations can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and damage.

### Prevention and treatment
Strive to achieve sufficient organ perfusion:

- measure blood pressure correctly and promptly
- measure blood pressure regularly and increase frequency when indicated
- consider inaccuracy and limitations of non-invasive blood pressure measurements
- maintain normovolemia and normal heart rate
- appropriate dosing of drugs
- compensate for sympathomimetic loss and consider use of vasoactive drugs
- consider monitoring perfusion by alternative means
- consider the potential inaccuracy and limitations of the measuring device and method
- avoid large fluctuations of blood pressure
- maintain normothermia, normocapnia and normoxia

## Normal Heart Rate (10Ns)

### Definition
Maintenance of expected heart rate within a normal range of the patient (age dependent)

### Importance
Autonomic control of the heart rate in utero is mediated predominantly via the parasympathetic nervous system. Just after birth the sympathetic control begins to appear, although the parasympathetic nervous system continues to dominate in childhood decreasing only in adolescence.

In neonates and infants, the heart rate may have a wide variation that is still within normal limits. The mean heart rate in neonates in the first 24 hours is 120 beats per minute, it increases to a mean of 160 beats per minute at 1 month of age, after which it gradually decreases to 75 beats per min at adolescence (Table 1).

In young children cardiac output is very much depended on heart rate and any heart rate \< 100 beats per minute should be explored further and treated if necessary.

In older children, a significant number of arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities are also encountered, with marked fluctuations in heart rate caused by variations in autonomic tone.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **Age*-   Mean heart rate in beats per minute (range)   ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------  Premature    120-170
   0-3 months   100-150
  3-6 months    90-120
   6-12 months   80-120
   1-3 years    70-110
    3-6 years   65-110
   6-12 years   60-95
    \> 12 years 55-85   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Table 1. The relationship between age and heart rate

### Consequences
Acute deviations from patient specific norms may result in physiologically and clinically relevant impairments of organ and tissue perfusions

### Prevention and treatment
Strive to achieve sufficient organ perfusion:

- monitor heart rate appropriately
- identify and treat underlying causes for bradycardia (hypoxemia, hypotension, drug errors, reflexes)
- prepare / administer epinephrine and/ or anticholinergics
- perform external cardiac compression in children if acute bradycardia (\< 60 bpm) and with signs of poor perfusion occurs

## Normoxemia (10Ns)

### Definition
Normal oxygen tension in the blood. Adequate oxygen supply permits aerobic metabolism.

### Importance

**Hypoxemia*- is commonly encountered during pediatric anesthesia. Prolonged hypoxemia may lead to adverse short and long-term outcomes.

**Hyperoxemia*- is iatrogenic and may result in the production of reactive oxygen species affecting normal organ function.

### Consequences
Acute and chronic changes in oxygen tensions results in physiologically and clinically relevant tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

#### Hypoxemia
Hypoxemia may result in severe tissue hypoxia, bradycardia, cerebral and other organ hypoperfusion.

#### Hyperoxemia
Prolonged hyperoxemia may affect organ development and function such as retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

### Prevention
- aim to achieve adequate oxygen tensions
- acute hypoxia is commonly a result of difficulties and critical incidences during airway and ventilation management

**Prevention requires:**

- regular teaching and training
- equipment and drugs
- suitable staffing
- assessment und preparation of patient
- local algorithms for the (un)expected / risky airway difficulties should be established.
- establish regulation for delivery of adequate FiO2 and ventilation management

## Normocapnia (10Ns)

### Definition
Maintenance of expected arterial carbon dioxide tension.

### Importance
Blood arterial carbon dioxide tensions are modified during anesthesia. Changes in arterial carbon dioxide tensions significantly affect body homeostasis including the acid-base status, the sympathomimetic tone and organ blood flow.

### Consequences
Acute and chronic changes in arterial carbon dioxide tensions lead to short and long-term outcomes:

- modulation of vasoreactivity
- central nervous system damage
- neuro-behavioral changes

### Prevention and treatment

- aim to achieve adequate carbon dioxide tensions
- acute changes in carbon dioxide tensions are commonly a result of difficulties and critical incidences during airway and ventilation management.

**Prevention requires:**

- regular teaching and training of ventilation strategies
- consider limitations of monitoring and airway equipment
- use cuffed endotracheal tubes if appropriate
- recognize discrepancies between arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide tensions
- Establish regulation for delivery of adequate ventilation management
- Avoid acute high amplitude fluctuations of arterial carbon dioxide tension

## Normonatremia (10Ns)

### Definition
Normal plasma sodium concentration within the age specific range.

### Importance
Plasma sodium is the major determinant of serum osmolality and therefore extracellular fluid volume. It is also a major determinant of neuronal excitability. Acute perioperative changes in plasma sodium concentrations are a leading cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality in children.

### Consequences
- acute and severe hyponatremia may result in neurological damage and death (cerebral edema, seizures, transtentorial herniation)
- rapid correction of hyponatremia may result in pontine myelinolysis.

### Prevention and treatment
- consider the need for prolonged parenteral fluid administration
- use balanced isotonic solutions
- regular perioperative assessment sodium if continuous fluid therapy
- avoid acute fluctuations of plasma sodium concentrations

## Normoglycemia (10Ns)

### Definition
Normal blood glucose concentration within the age specific normal range.

### Importance
Blood glucose homeostasis is important for ensuring a continuing energy supply and stable plasma osmolality. Small infants have reduced glycogen storage capacity and hence have a limited ability to maintain blood glucose concentrations during periods of fasting.

### Consequences
Acute and chronic changes in blood glucose concentrations have significant consequences to the perioperative outcome.

#### Hypoglycemia
- irritability
- seizures
- hemodynamic instability
- coma, death

#### Hyperglycemia
- hyperosmolality
- ketoacidosis
- polyuria and dehydration and
- seizures, death

### Prevention and treatment
- awareness of fasting and nutrition status of the patient, minimize preoperative fasting times
- perioperative (surgical) stress reduction (analgesia and body temperature control)
- situation appropriate monitoring (neonates, critically ill children) and investigations
- consider isotonic glucose containing perioperative intravenous solutions especially in preterm, neonates and small infants, patient on total parental nutrition (TPN) and critically ill patients
- patients with inherited and acquired endocrine or glucose dependent metabolic disorders require special attention and workup
- prompt and appropriate treatment of significant hypo- and hyperglycemia

## Normothermia (10Ns)

### Definition
Body temperature within the normal physiological range

### Importance and Consequences

**Hypothermia*- is a common problem in children exposed to anesthetic drugs -- especially in the youngest age groups. Hypothermia during anesthesia has many harmful consequences and may trigger multiple physiological changes (increased metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, prolonged bleeding time and increased risk for postoperative infection) and influence the pharmacokinetic and --dynamics of anesthetics.

**Hyperthermia*- most commonly occurs because of iatrogenic overheating and failure to decrease the temperature of the exogenous heat source in the face of an increasingly body temperature. Other causes of hyperthermia include malignant hyperthermia, thyrotoxicosis and sepsis.

### Prevention and Treatment
Temperature can be monitored in the axilla, bladder, nasopharynx, esophagus, rectum, tympanic membrane and the skin. Core temperature is most accurately measured on the tympanic membrane or the esophagus.

Core temperature monitoring should be monitored in procedures lasting more than 30 min with an effort to maintain temperature \> 36°C. External forced-air warming should be used to prevent hypothermia. Ambient temperature should be maintained between 21°and 26°C with a relative humidity level of 40-60%. IV solutions should be considered warmed to 38°C in high risk cases.

## No Postoperative Discomfort

## No Pain (10Ns)
It refers to the concept No Postoperative Discomfort

### Definition
Unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such.

### Importance
A large number of children still experience significant pain in the perioperative period. Poor pain control remains a significant problem following hospital discharge.

### Consequences
Inadequate peri-operative pain control can lead to a variety of behavioral and somatic changes.

**These include:**

- altered behavior (emotional)
- subsequent altered pain perception
- prolonged hospital stays and increased re-admission rates
- chronic pain
- negative parental perception
- social consequences

### Good Practice Points
- regularly assess pain in all children to "make pain visible"
- chart pain as a vital sign
- ensure clear appropriate protocols to bring pain scores down and to maintain low pain scores
- reassess pain after analgesic interventions to ensure efficacy and to minimize side effects (titration)
- use multimodal analgesia and opioid-sparing techniques where possible and as appropriate
- ensure continuing analgesia at home

### Follow-Up/ Outcome
- audit pain assessments, high pain scores and pain at home and plan QI initiatives
- audit adverse effects, critical incidents and drug errors and make plans to reduce incidence

## No PONV (10Ns)

### Definition
The term PONV is used to describe nausea and/ or vomiting or retching in the immediate 24 postoperative hours.

### Importance
Children undergoing anesthesia and surgery are at high risk for PONV. PONV leads to additional discomfort, morbidity and costs.

### Consequences
PONV is an unpleasant experience resulting in a variety of significant consequences which include:

- additional burden for the child, parents, clinician and nurses
- increased postoperative morbidity, pain, dehydration and surgical complications
- delayed discharge and increased re-admission
- additional medication and increased workload

### Good Practice Points
- assess risk factors from patient history, type of surgery and type of anesthesia
- establish local standard operating protocols for the prevention and treatment of PONV according to current evidence-based guidelines (see below)
- be aware of factors unrelated to current condition which could cause or exacerbate PONV (intestinal, brain, hypotension, allergic reaction, drug side effects)

### Follow-Up/ Outcome
- audit incidence and severity of PONV
- audit use of antiemetic protocols and compliance with protocols
- QI initiatives to reduce in-hospital and post-discharge PONV

### Key references
- "This is the 2nd edition of the APAGBI evidence-based guidelines on prevention of postoperative vomiting in children from 2016.

## No Emergence Delirium (10Ns)

### Definition
Emergence delirium is part of an early negative postoperative behavior. It is an abnormal mental state following anesthesia and surgery and separate to pain.

### Importance
Emergence delirium is common following general anesthesia in young children. Effective recognition and treatment is essential to reduce self-inflicted injuries and improve satisfaction of parents and caregivers.

### Consequences
Emergence delirium may result in self-injury of the child and increase the healthcare requirements:

- emergence delirium reduces parental and caregivers' satisfaction
- short- and long-term psychological implications of emergence delirium are unclear
- children with emergence delirium may have a higher risk of developing separation anxiety, apathy, and sleep and eating disorders

### Good practice points
- be aware of risk factors and triggers
- ensure appropriate information for child and parents is given in advance
- effective local standardized protocols for prevention, recognition and treatment including non-drug treatment and involvement of parents in recovery process after anesthesia

Critical events in pediatric anesthesia are common (up to 10% of all children) and can lead to morbidity and mortality.
Essential Standard Operating Protocols (SOP) in addition to education, teaching and training are necessary for the prevention, prompt recognition and appropriate treatment of critical situations.
The instant availability of essential drugs, equipment and support staff is required in addition to these SOPs. The most common acute and life-threatening complications require intuitive, clear and goal directed SOPs.
Below are examples of the ten most common life-threatening critical situations and approaches in pediatric anesthesia care.

- Can´t Oxygenate -- Can´t Ventilate
- Can´t Intubate
- Can Intubate -- Can't Oxygenate
- Can´t Cannulate -- Failed Venous Access
- Anaphylaxis
- Major Haemorrhage
- Perioperative Pulmonary Aspiration
- Tonsillar Bleeding
- Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity -- LAST
- Malignant Hyperthermia Crisis -- MH

## Can´t Oxygenate-Ventilate (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

### Summary
Can't oxygenate-ventilate situations in children are common and are usually due to functional and/or anatomical airway obstructions. Early recognition and treatment with appropriate skills, equipment and drugs can overcome these situations in otherwise healthy children.

### Background
- most common complication with potential serious morbidity and mortality
- most frequent complication in otherwise healthy children
- often associated with lack of skills, knowledge, education, training, experience and the use of age inappropriate equipment
- infants and toddlers at particular risk
- high risk surgeries (ENT)

### Prevention

#### Identify children at risk
- the child with acute airway infection, bronchial hyperactivity, asthma, allergic predisposition
- premature, neonates, infants and toddlers
- history, signs and symptoms predictive for difficult airway
- obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)
- acquired and congenital airway abnormalities and diseases

#### Strict transfer policy regarding children at risk

#### Seek experienced consultation and help early

#### Infrastructure and competence
Anesthesia for children should be undertaken or supervised by anesthetists who have undergone appropriate education, training and experience
- suitable anesthesia environment
- appropriate patient positioning
- basic age specific airway equipment
- appropriate depth of anesthesia
- immediate access to emergency drugs (prepared)
- pre-oxygenation as appropriate and accepted by patient

### Treatment
- recognize and treat anatomical/mechanical airway obstruction
- call for help early
- recognize and treat functional airway obstruction
- exclude and treat foreign body airway obstruction
- perform endotracheal intubation / insert laryngeal mask airway
- (Can't oxygenate, can't intubate (COCI) -- invasive oxygenation/ ventilation via front of neck airway)
- Post Care
- debriefing is essential (patient, parent, staff)
- ensure good documentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet)

## Can´t Intubate (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

### Summary
Skills and in-depth knowledge are essential. It is important to recognize airway abnormalities before any airway manipulation. Call for help early if doubts about the ability to ventilate exist. Limit the tracheal intubation attempts and always consider a supraglottic airway as an alternative.

### Background
- the trachea of the vast majority of children is usually easy to intubate
- patients do not come to harm because they cannot be intubated but are harmed because of repeated attempts to intubate their trachea
- often associated with lack of skills, knowledge, education, training, experience and use of age inappropriate equipment
- infants and toddlers are at particular risk
- Prevention

#### Identify children at risk
- children aged \<1 year (unfamiliar anatomy and limited experience)
- previous difficult intubation
- craniofacial deformities and facial dysmorphia
- airway abnormalities associated with genetic syndromes and diseases
- acquired abnormalities (burns, contractures, hardware)
- Strict transfer policy regarding children at risk

#### Seek experienced consultation and help early

#### Infrastructure and competence
Anesthesia for children should be undertaken or supervised by anesthetists who have undergone appropriate education, training and experience

- suitable anesthesia environment
- appropriate patient positioning
- basic age specific airway equipment
- adequate depth of anesthesia and muscle paralysis
- use of appropriate technique including external laryngeal manipulation
- pre-oxygenation as appropriate and accepted by patient

### Treatment
- limit initial tracheal intubation attempts to maximum 2 attempts
- maintain oxygenation, ventilation and anesthesia at all times.
- consider indication for intubation and possibility to use supraglottic airway or face mask only
- alternative airway technique or operator according to local expertise
- insert supraglottic airway for emergency situations or for awakening of patient for postponing the procedure

### Post Care
- debriefing (patient, parent, staff)
- documentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet)

## Can Intubate -- Can't Oxygenate (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

### Summary
Persistent post-intubation hypoxia can rapidly lead to morbidity and even mortality. Early recognition and effective intervention using a structured approach is required.

### Background
- small children have short and narrow airways requiring small and fragile airway equipment
- obstruction and dislocation of airway devices are common during moving and positioning
- gastric distension significantly reduces functional residual capacity in small children and may considerably impair ventilation and gas exchange
- limited oxygenation and respiratory reserves in small children result in rapid development of hypoxemia, carbon dioxide accumulation and respiratory acidosis. High closing capacity in small children increases likelihood of pulmonary atelectasis leading to intra-pulmonary shunt and hypoxemia
- rapid administration of potent opioids may lead to thoracic rigidity
- pediatric patients are at higher risk for bronchial hyper-reactivity particularly those with respiratory infection, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or allergic diathesis
- congenital and acquired diseases may affect lower airway patency or can lead to an acute tracheal tube obstruction

### Prevention
- correct positioning of tracheal tube and safe, effective fixation of airway devices is paramount
- suitable and careful positioning and moving of patients with tracheal tube. Reassess proper position of airway devices after re-positioning.
- ensure stable position when oral procedures (ENT, cleft surgery, gastroenterology, cardiology (transesophageal echocardiography) are performed
- ensure adequate depth of anesthesia (+/- muscle paralysis)
- perform appropriate ventilation and recruitment strategies
- consider gastric decompression following airway manoeuvres
- children with copious secretions or pus are at risk of tracheal tube obstruction and patency requires regular checking and confirmation

### Treatment
- call for assistance, if in doubt -- take it out
- the acronym DOPES summarizes the most relevant immediately life-threatening causes and interventions that effectively treat the 'Can Intubate -- Can't Ventilate' situation
- Exclude and treat
- **D*- -- Displacement of tracheal tube (endobronchial, esophageal and pharyngeal)
- **O*- -- Obstruction of tracheal tube, respiratory valves or respiratory filter with secretion and functional airway obstructions (severe bronchospasm, opioids)
- **P*- -- Pneumothorax
- **E*- -- Equipment problems (disconnection, kinking of respiratory tubing)
- **S*- -- Stomach & Specials (increased intra-abdominal pressure, pulmonary pathology, pulmonary-arterial hypertension, cardiac right-to-left shunts, alveolar collapse)

### Post Care
- debriefing is essential (patient, parent, staff)
- documentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet) if appropriate
- follow--up if and when required

## Can´t Cannulate -- Failed Venous Access (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

### Summary
Intra-osseous access is the access of choice in life threatening emergencies

### Background
- venous access in children can be difficult resulting in multiple attempts and may fail
- delays in obtaining venous access can result in morbidity particularly during emergencies
- those most at risk are young children, the chronically ill, obese or premature infants
- intra-osseous access has no reported associated mortality in contrast to emergency central venous access

### Prevention
- careful clinical evaluation and preparation (patient, team, equipment and environment)
- maintain hydration (short fasting times)
- use topical anesthesia for awake cannulation

### Treatment
- use the vein you can see
- call for assistance
- failed conventional venous puncture may require alternative venous access techniques (ultrasound, vein light, vein viewer or others) and operator
- intra-osseous access is the access of choice in life threatening emergencies

### Post Care
- ensure secure taping of successful venous access
- consider establishing longterm central venous access (PICC, port, Broviac, Hickmann lines)

## Anaphylaxis (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

### Summary
- anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening, generalized or systemic hypersensitivity reaction
- anaphylaxis is very rare in children but requires swift and effective recognition and treatment

### Background
- severe anaphylactic reactions in children are rare
- main triggers are antibiotics, colloids, hypnotics, muscle relaxants, intravenous contrast and latex
- prompt recognition and early treatment is required to avoid morbidity and mortality

### Prevention
- take careful patient history
- high index of suspicion if severe hypotension and/or bronchospasm occurs
- knowledge of potential cross-reactivity
- eliminate potential triggers (latex free environment)
- ensure availability of effective drug treatments
- alternative diagnosis: Intestinal eventration syndrome, local anesthetic systemic toxicity

### Treatment
- call for help
- stop the triggering agent
- give epinephrine 10 micrograms/kg IM, repeat iv as required
- give epinephrine IV (1-2-3-5-10 micrograms/kg) titrated according to effect
- maintain/ establish airway, give high flow oxygen, monitor vital signs
- consider raising legs/ fluid challenge if hypotension
- give antihistamines and steroids

### Post Care
- take three timed blood samples for serum tryptase (as soon as possible, 1-2 hours and \>24h after event)
- develop urgent management plan according to clinical needs
- monitor patient carefully in the postoperative period
- provide patient letter and letter to family physician
- arrange referral to allergy clinic

## Major Hemorrhage (10Cs)
This page is part of the Safetots Crisis SOPs, a framework for prevention and treatment of the most relevant crisis situations in pediatric anaesthesia.

### Summary
Major perioperative hemorrhage is the leading cause of severe morbidity and mortality in children and its successful management requires close co-operation with the surgical team.

### Background
Unexpected major surgical hemorrhage is the leading cause for perioperative cardiac arrests in children. Morbidity and mortality during major hemorrhage is related to insufficient venous access, inadequate monitoring, underestimation of blood loss, lack of control of clotting and access to blood products.

### Prevention
- know your patient
- know your surgeon and intended procedure
- smart choice of number and type of vascular access and monitoring
- maintain normovolemia, look for signs of hypovolemia (capillary refill time, arterial pulse wave)
- consider clotting and hemostasis
- be prepared for the unexpected sudden blood loss (fluids, blood, equipment for intraosseous access, epinephrine)

### Treatment
- early call for help and additional resources
- determine cause, collaborate with surgeon (tamponade/ embolization/ cross clamping)
- consider additional venous or intra-osseous access as required
- give fluids/volume
- catecholamines
- consider tranexamic acid
- monitor hemostasis repeatedly -\> laboratory, viscoelastic testing (e.g. ROTEM, TEG)
- order and give blood products and clotting factors as indicated
- consult with hematologist and intensivist
- consider and exclude other reasons for hemodynamic instability (cardiologist)

### Post Care
- re-establish normovolemia and hemostasis
- delayed extubation (PICU)
- careful documentation
- follow-up
- patient disclosure and debriefing

## Perioperative Pulmonary Aspiration (10Cs)

### Summary
Perioperative pulmonary aspiration is a rare event provided that the airway technique and device has been selected according to the patient risk factors.

### Background
Peri-operative pulmonary aspiration is rare in pediatric anesthesia and usually has a good outcome.

### Prevention
- strict adherence to fasting instructions and recognition of patients with delayed gastric emptying or with a full stomach
- patients with intestinal obstruction require a naso-gastric tube
- choice of appropriate induction technique and airway device
- controlled Rapid Sequence Induction and Intubation (RSII) requires rapid induction of anesthesia, deep muscle relaxation and gentle face mask ventilation to maintain oxygenation, ventilation and anesthesia
- ensure sufficient depth of anesthesia (+/- muscle relaxation) to avoid coughing, bucking, straining resulting in regurgitation of gastric content and pulmonary aspiration

### Treatment
- call for assistance and help
- place patient in lateral and head down position
- suction clearance of airway content and secure airway with tracheal intubation
- no broncho-alveolar lavage
- solid foreign body aspiration may require bronchoscopy and extraction
- lung recruitment maneuver if required
- postpone non-emergency surgery if severe aspiration suspected
- chest x-ray, steroids or prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely required unless symptoms persist
- attempt early extubation

### Post Care
- hospital discharge is possible if asymptomatic after 2 hours

## Tonsillar Bleeding (10Cs)

### Summary
A common potentially life-threatening emergency in children that requires a standardized and effective, locally agreed hospital approach.

### Background
Post-tonsillectomy bleeding occurs in up to 5% of all tonsillectomies with 50% surgical revision. Mortality occurs in up to 1:30 000 patients usually due to delayed intervention. Anesthetic challenges are hypovolemia, difficult airway (bleeding and swelling), full stomach (blood) and difficult venous access.

### Prevention
- patients require fluid resuscitation prior to induction of anesthesia unless the rate of bleeding exceeds the ability to replacement volume
- early intravenous/ intra-osseous access is required
- a hospital care pathway needs to be established with all team members (emergency physicians, anesthetist, surgeon and nurse) work from the same instructions, precise lines of communication, information required and clinical guidance to achieve the optimal care
- must have a pre-defined role in this scenario
- anticipate a difficult tracheal intubation
- prepare adequate airway equipment and drugs
- two suction sources available

### Treatment
- controlled Rapid Sequence Induction and Intubation with gentle face mask ventilation following induction of anesthesia and securing the airway with a cuffed tracheal tube is used to avoid severe hypoxemia
- evaluate intraoperative hemostasis
- empty stomach using an oro-gastric (placed by surgeon under direct vision) prior to extubation
- ensure hemostasis proper surgical revision before extubation of the awake and hemodynamically stable patient
- Post Care
- consider delayed extubation in case of severe bleeding, unstable patient or unclear coagulation
- consider tranexamic acid in severe tonsillar bleeding
- consider referral to hematologist if hereditary coagulation order is suspected

## Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity -- LAST (10Cs)

### Summary
Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) in children can be prevented by slow injection of local anesthetic agents and careful monitoring for clinical signs. Primary treatment is directed to maintaining oxygenation and circulation before initiating lipid rescue.

### Background
- local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) occurs when large quantities of local anesthetics reach the systemic circulation and depends on multiple variables and presents in various clinical ways ranging from mild neurological symptoms to cardiac toxicity and death
- early symptoms and signs of LAST are masked in children if regional anesthesia is administered during general anesthesia and sedation
- cardiac toxicity of local anesthetics is increased by acidosis and hypoxemia

### Prevention
- knowledge of maximum dose and concentration is essential and it is important to individualize the choice of drug, dose and concentration based on the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities
- the 'Stop before you block' principle allows checking of patient relevant information, dose, contra-indication and type and site of regional anesthesia before injection local anesthetics
- careful aspiration, passive back-flow, slow injection, test dose with added epinephrine (1:200,000) and close hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure in 1-minute intervals, pulse oximetry and ECG) allows early detection of inadvertent systemic administration and avoidance of LAST
- confirm maximum dose of continuous administration local anesthetic for neonates and infants as well older children
- ensure availability of:

- Resuscitative equipment and drugs
- Airway equipment: the means to provide bag mask ventilation, oral and nasal airways, laryngoscopes and endotracheal tubes, laryngeal mask airways

### Treatment
- when suspecting LAST, stop injecting more local anesthetic and call for help
- supportive measures to maintain the airway and oxygenation and treating seizures are usually sufficient
- maintaining cardiac output using epinephrine and external cardiac massage if necessary results in re-distribution and clearance of the local anesthetic
- secondary administration of lipid solutions may be useful in severe cases and hasten recovery from LAST

### Post Care
- patient disclosure and careful documentation are required
- if an allergic reaction is considered arrange further workup and follow-up

## Malignant Hyperthermia Crisis -- MH (10Cs)

### Summary
Malignant hyperthermia crisis occurs in response to volatile anesthetic agents and depolarizing muscle relaxants (suxamethonium). Prevention and immediate treatment with dantrolene is life-saving.

### Background
- malignant hyperthermia is a life-threatening metabolic response to volatile anesthetic agents or succinylcholine (suxamethonium). Previous uneventful exposure to these agents does not guarantee safe use
- mortality may approach 70% if untreated, with dantrolene treatment mortality approximates 3-5%

### Prevention
- recognition of patients at risk through careful medical and family history and/ or consultation with specialist Malignant Hyperthermia reference center
- do not use volatiles or succinylcholine (suxamethonium) in patients at risk
- reduce preoperative anxiety
- use a vapor free anesthetic machine if possible, if not available prepare machine according to manufacturer's guidelines and use a new breathing circuit, rebreathing bag, and gas sampling tubes
- consider vapor scavenging filters
- ensure dantrolene availability

### Treatment
Call for help early, initiate action plan and allocate specific tasks:

- stop potential trigger agents immediately and give 100% oxygen
- consider installing clean breathing system, remove inhalational agents and increase fresh gas flow to maximum, consider vapor scavenging filters
- hyperventilate to achieve normocapnia
- maintain anesthesia using non-volatile anesthetics and opioids as well as non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, curtail surgery if possible
- give dantrolene (2.5mg/kg every 5 minutes until effect -- max. 20mg/kg): need to assign one person to correctly reconstitute dantrolene from powder formulation
- active cooling
- treat or prevent hyperkalemia, acidosis, arrhythmias (no calcium channel antagonists) and prevent acute renal failure and coagulopathy
- continuous monitoring of vital signs including peripheral and core temperature, invasive monitoring for repeated blood sampling
- check plasma CK

### Post Care
- continue monitoring postoperatively on PICU, repeat dantrolene as required
- repeat plasma CK
- monitor and prevent acute renal failure and compartment syndrome
- counsel patient and family members
- arrange referral to Malignant Hyperthermia Unit

### Why Research into Safe Conduct of Anesthesia is important
The most important unsolved question is how to define "safe conduct" in pediatric anesthesia. In other words, what outcomes should we use to measure the "success" of anesthesia and perioperative care? This research priority generates many more fundamental questions:

- What outcomes matter most to our patients and their families?
- What outcomes are most important to clinicians?
- What are the most important outcome measures for clinical researchers?
- Are these outcomes aligned?
- Can we, do we, should we routinely measure these outcomes in everyday clinical practice and/or in clinical trials?
- How can we improve these outcomes? (See Quality Improvement)

### What are the necessary steps to determine outcomes?

#### Identification of outcome measures and indicators
Clinical expert- along with other stakeholders-based consensus is necessary to identify indicators that could act as outcome measures in upcoming observational studies and trials. Such outcome measures have been established in adults and effort is currently under way in pediatric populations.

#### Establishment of large multi-centric electronic databases of perioperative electronic records and pre-identified indicators
Such global Big data approach will foster benchmarking and continuous quality assessment/improvement at the individual, institutional and inter-institutional levels. It will also facilitate clinical research at a large scale.

#### Epidemiological studies, observational studies and trials
Conduct of clinical research based on generally accepted and pre-identified outcome measures/indicators will most probably present a higher public health relevance. Such an approach will also facilitate comparing studies between each other and may open the way to increased funding resources.

#### The influence of clinical expertise on outcome
There is a general agreement between pediatric anesthesia providers that expertise matters on outcome. Although, for obvious ethical reasons, no randomized trial design can address this issue, there is epidemiological data suggesting a positive correlation between the level of expertise and outcome (or on the incidence of critical events).

#### Pre-clinical and clinical physiological studies to determine "safe"

**While there is a general consensus between anesthesia providers to maintain physiological parameters in the "normal" or "safe" range*- during the perioperative period, we often do not know what these safe values are. For example, the physiological range of blood pressure that allows adequate organ perfusion and oxygen delivery to pediatric populations during the perioperative period is essentially unknown. Relatedly, the systemic blood pressure values leading to cerebral hypoperfusion are poorly defined. Neither we know to what extent intraoperative cerebral hypoperfusion may lead to brain injury during routine general anesthesia. The interaction between hypotension -- hypo/hyperglycemia -- hyo/hypercapnia in the perioperative setting also remains to be determined. Both preclinical laboratory models and clinical investigations will be necessary to better elucidate these questions.

#### Research on neurodevelopmental outcomes

**Over the past 15 years,*- there has been considerable interests about the effects of general anesthetics on the developing brain. Laboratory studies have shown that these drugs can have a variety effects on the developing animal brain. Retrospective human epidemiological observations have revealed mixed results, while prospective studies and trials showed no impact of anesthesia/surgery on neurodevelopmental outcome as assessed by a battery of cognitive tests. Based on available current evidence, the European Consensus statement on the use of general anesthesia in pediatric populations recommends no change in clinical practice.

**There are, nevertheless, several questions remaining open.*- First, we do not know whether our current methodology to evaluate neuromorbidity is appropriate or some aspects of behavior/cognition are missed. Second, we do not know if there are specific genetic/epigenetic backgrounds displaying increased vulnerability to anesthesia/surgery. Third, we do not know how anesthetic drugs interact with surgery and other perioperative factors in terms neuromorbidity. Both preclinical models and clinical studies are warranted on these questions.

**One important issue is that,*- since we do not know how to measure it, we do not directly measure neuromorbidity in the perioperative period. Research and development of tools (along with the validation of these tools) to measure neuromorbidity will be essential to gain further insights into the effects of the perioperative period on the developing human brain.

### Why is Quality Improvement (QI) important in pediatric anesthesia?
Quality improvement (QI) is a key part of improving outcomes and services. QI methodology uses cycles of change with continuous monitoring of process outcomes with methods such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) or Six Sigma. Key to improving services is measuring outcome with high quality simple data and a local culture open to change and focusing on care quality.

### Clear strategies and recommendations for areas of Quality Improvement include:

- Standardization of serious critical event definitions and reporting
- Implementation of current best practice in provision of competent pediatric anesthesia (see 10Ns)
- Development of evidence-based protocols for management and training of serious critical events (see 10Cs)
- Implementation of systems for ensuring maintenance of skills
- The Institutional Competences are addressed in 'Who', 'Where', 'When', 'What' and 'How' need to be identified to achieve an optimal outcome for vulnerable children.

What to include in discussions of benefits and risks of anesthesia and analgesia with children, parents and families

### How can I reassure parents who are worried about the risks of anesthesia and analgesia?

### What do we know about the risks of anesthesia and analgesia?
Peri-operative complications occur more often in neonates, infants and young children when compared with older children and adults, and morbidity and mortality risks are higher at younger ages. The incidence and severity of peri-operative complications are dependent on young age (reduced physiological reserves), pre-operative morbidity, urgency of the procedure as well as the training and experience of the anesthesiologist and the anesthesia team. There is a deﬁnite causal relationship between preventable poor peri-operative anesthetic care and adverse events with persistent poor neurological outcome and mortality in neonates, infants and small children.
This table gives an idea of risks and how often they might occur.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Risk      Risk level   Description   ----------------- ------------ ---------------------------------------- Restlessness  1 in 10  Very common ("someone in your family")
  Sickness  1 in 10  Very common 
  Dizziness     1 in 10  Very common
  Headache  1 in 100 Common ("someone in a street")
  Chest infection   1 in 1000    Uncommon ("someone in a village")
  Damage to teeth   1 in 1000    Uncommon
  Awareness     1 in 1000    Uncommon
  Serious allergy   1 in 10 000  Rare ("someone in a small town")   to drugs       
  Serious   1 in 10 000  Rare   complication of       local anaesthesia      
  Serious   1 in 10 000  Rare   complication of       strong pain       killers        
  Brain damage  \< 1 in 100  Very rare ("someone in a large town")     000  
  Death     \<\< 1 in    Very rare     100 000  
                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Compared to the risk of car travel, the risk of serious harm from anesthesia is very small.

### What can I do to minimize risks?
Pediatric anesthesia is usually safe in experienced hands and in well-organized anesthesia departments. Neonates, infants and children with complex needs or undergoing major surgery should be treated in centers by experienced pediatric teams. Older, otherwise healthy children for common elective procedures who are treated in non-pediatric hospitals beneﬁt from anesthesiologists trained and experienced in pediatric anesthesia.A specialist pediatric anesthesiologist has been trained for a minimum of one year at a large pediatric center and may also have a specialist pediatric anesthesia certiﬁcation.
Good pediatric anesthesia care also requires well trained pediatric nurses, pediatric post-anesthesia recovery facilities, established standard operating protocols (SOPs) as well as continuous education and training. These recommendations apply to all places where children are anesthetized.

### What should I say to the parents or carers of a young infant who express concern about anesthesia and the potential for long-term effects on the brain?
There is no proven direct causal adverse effect of general anesthetics on human brain development. Recent reviews of the animal and clinical literature , and the outcome of the GAS study conclude that there is now strong evidence that short single exposure to anesthesia in early life is not associated with any long term significant measurable risk in humans. Some large population-based studies have found evidence for a small difference in tests of academic achievement and school readiness but the differences are small (for example, around 1% decrement in IQ) and this would not have a noticeable impact on the child. Any added risk of anesthesia and surgery is up to 10 times less than other factors such as gender or maternal education. Some studies have found evidence of an association between surgery and anesthesia in early life and increased risk of behavioral disorder or learning disability but the added risk is very small.

**The central points to explain and emphasize are that:**
- the surgery or procedure is only being scheduled because it is necessary
- surgery cannot be safely performed without adequate anesthesia and analgesia
- most anaesthetics in children are of short duration
- all babies and children are closely monitored during anesthesia and surgery to maximize safety and minimize side- effects
- the aim is to provide careful management of pediatric anesthesia by trained personnel within a safe environment respecting the rights of the child (see Rights of the Child, Competence, Quality)
- there are currently no data to indicate that a single, well conducted anesthetic of short duration causes long-term changes in brain development
- experimental data and measures used in animals cannot be extrapolated to indicate long-term effects in human infants

### If I am called to anesthetize a young infant should I instigate a discussion about long-term effects of anesthesia on the developing brain?
This depends on the medicolegal approach to disclosure of risks in your country. It is important to do this in an open and non-alarming way and to give reassurance that for all the common risks and potential adverse effects, measures are taken to prevent or minimize these. Rare risks should be mentioned in context and related to risks of everyday life. There may be specific risks for an individual child due to young age, past history, comorbidities, complexity of the surgery or invasiveness of the anesthetic procedure and these should be identified and included in the discussion.

### Should I alter my current anesthesia practice in response to the current evidence base information or other published statements?
There is currently no evidence to support one particular anesthetic technique or drug regimen that has beneﬁt over another in terms of reducing the potential effects of anesthesia on the infant brain. In addition, changing anesthesia practice from a familiar to an unfamiliar technique can itself introduce risk. Trials have begun of new techniques involving agents with neuroprotective properties but results will not be available for some time.

### Is repeated exposure or long duration exposure to anesthetic agents more harmful than short- duration single exposure?
There is only extremely weak human evidence to support the FDA warning that repeated or lengthy use of anesthetic drugs may affect the development of children's brains. Current data on multiple exposures or longer-term exposures are unsuitable to answer this question at this time and unlikely to be resolved in the future. Evidence from both epidemiological and prospective studies indicates that a single exposure to anesthesia of an hour is safe in terms of brain development. The epidemiological studies carried out so far have not shown major adverse effects on the infant brain that can be speciﬁcally related to anesthesia. Infants who need multiple anesthetics or those who require complex surgery and anesthesia of long duration usually have additional comorbidities that can affect development.

### If parents still remain unsure or are concerned about providing consent for anesthesia and surgery, what should I do? 
In the rare case when parents or carers remain sufficiently concerned to withhold consent for elective procedures, it may be necessary to organize a further discussion with all the relevant disciplines, to discuss the beneﬁts of the procedure/surgery and risks of delay. This may result in postponement for cases that are not urgent. Emergency or urgent surgery may still need to take place, and risks associated with delay clearly outweigh the theoretical issues about anesthesia on long-term cognitive development.

### What can I do to improve the quality of my care?
There are many excellent resources that summarize quality improvement science and give examples of quality improvement in anesthesia and perioperative care, including pediatric practice:

### Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Does my child need a general anesthetic?
If a procedure or test is needed in a child, especially if it may cause distress or pain, or if it may take a long time, or needs the child to be very still, then anesthesia may be needed. Sometimes sedation is an alternative but often anesthesia is more reliable and as safe or safer. If no anesthesia was given for such tests or procedures the results would be bad and severe distress and harm could be caused.

### Is anesthesia for children safe?
Most anesthetics in children are short and are for small operations or procedures. These are usually safe in experienced hands and in well-organized departments that are used to caring for children.

### Why may some children get more problems with anesthesia? 
Smaller, younger and sicker children may have more problems with anesthesia because there is a smaller safety margin around normal and changes from normal can happen much more quickly. This is especially so in emergency or urgent cases.
Children who have complex surgery or longer procedures may also be more at risk of problems. The team needs a lot of training and experience to care for children to keep them safe during and after anesthesia and surgery.

### What sort of problems can occur and how common are they?
This table gives an idea of risks and how often they might occur.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Risk    Risk level    Description   ------------------- ------------- ------------------------------------- Restlessness    1 in 10   Very common ("someone in your         family")
  Sickness    1 in 10   Very common 
  Dizziness   1 in 10   Very common
  Headache    1 in 100  Common ("someone in a street")
  Chest infection 1 in 1000 Uncommon ("someone in a village")

  Serious allergy to  1 in 10 000   Rare ("someone in a small town")   drugs         
  Serious     1 in 10 000   Rare   complication of      local anesthesia      
  Serious     1 in 10 000   Rare   complication of      strong pain killers   
  Brain damage    \< 1 in 100   Very rare ("someone in a large town")       000   
  Death   \<\< 1 in 100 Very rare       000   
                    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
To put this in perspective, the risk of serious damage from an anesthetic is much less than the risk of travelling in a car.

### Is one anesthetic better than others?
At the moment there is no proof that one way of giving anesthesia is better than any other but your anesthesiologist will be able to advise on the preferred method for your child.

### Do anesthetic agents affect the intelligence and development of my child?
There is strong evidence in humans that a single, short, well-conducted anesthetic does not have effects on brain development. There is weak evidence that for long, or lots of anesthetics, some effects on behavior and learning in later life may be seen but this has to be balanced against the need for the procedure. Any effects of the anesthetic are around ten times less than other known factors.
Younger children have an increased risk of problems so could my child's operation be delayed until they are older?
The best age for a procedure should be discussed openly with your team as for some cases there are risks in delaying or postponing procedures.

### Is it ok to ask if my surgeon and anesthesiologist are qualiﬁed to look after my child?
Absolutely. Evidence of qualiﬁcations, training, and experience should be available, and your doctor will be able to show this at an appropriate time. Many doctors also take part in quality assurance programs. Some hospitals have a special accreditation for care of children and are subject to peer review to make sure standards are met and maintained.

### What can I as a parent do to help my child?
Being present to give information and comfort to your child are helpful although it can be stressful for you.
