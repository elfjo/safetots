### Why is Quality Improvement (QI) important in pediatric anesthesia?
Quality improvement (QI) is a key part of improving outcomes and services. QI methodology uses cycles of change with continuous monitoring of process outcomes with methods such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) or Six Sigma. Key to improving services is measuring outcome with high quality simple data and a local culture open to change and focusing on care quality.

### Clear strategies and recommendations for areas of Quality Improvement include:

- Standardization of serious critical event definitions and reporting
- Implementation of current best practice in provision of competent pediatric anesthesia (see 10Ns)
- Development of evidence-based protocols for management and training of serious critical events (see 10Cs)
- Implementation of systems for ensuring maintenance of skills
- The Institutional Competences are addressed in 'Who', 'Where', 'When', 'What' and 'How' need to be identified to achieve an optimal outcome for vulnerable children.
